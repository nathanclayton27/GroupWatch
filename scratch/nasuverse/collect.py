"""Collect real lengths for every row of properties/nasuverse.json.

    PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python scratch/nasuverse/collect.py

Writes tools/data/nasuverse.json, which tools/make_nasuverse.py reads. The
generator itself never touches the network, so it stays byte-for-byte
re-runnable; this script is the only thing that fetches.

Nasuverse is six media in one hour-weighted list, so it needs three sources
and refuses a number when none of them has one:

  * GAMES and VISUAL NOVELS -> HowLongToBeat main-story figures, through
    tools/gwlib/hltb.py's verify-by-name gate. A record only counts when its
    name normalizes to the row's and its year sits inside the window.
  * FILMS and ANIME -> the runtime the work's own Wikipedia infobox carries,
    read here rather than typed. A row is weighted only when that box gives
    ONE unambiguous figure: a single runtime for a one-off, or a single
    per-episode runtime AND a single integer episode count for a series.
  * NOVELS and MANGA -> nothing. Pages are not hours, which is the same
    refusal tools/make_dune.py and tools/make_middle_earth.py make.

Anything that fails ships UNWEIGHTED with the reason written into the data
file, where the generator asserts it exists. The rules that produced the
refusals below, in the order they bit:

  * A RANGE IS NOT A FIGURE. Carnival Phantasm's episodes run "8-20
    minutes"; Unlimited Blade Works lists three different lengths. Picking
    one, or averaging them, would be inventing.
  * A COUNT WITH A PLUS IN IT IS NOT A COUNT. "10 + OVA", "13 + 2 SP",
    "21 + 1 special" cannot be multiplied by anything.
  * NEVER BILL THE SAME THING TWICE. The Garden of Sinners row IS the seven
    2007-2009 films, and "A Study in Murder, Part 2" is the seventh of them
    with a row of its own, so only the seven-film row carries the hours.
    Same rule that leaves Mega Man Battle Network 3's Blue and White halves
    unweighted.
  * A REMASTER IS NOT A SEPARATE ENTRY. HowLongToBeat times Fate/stay night
    and Fate/hollow ataraxia once each; the 2024 and 2025 remasters have no
    record of their own, and copying the original's figure across editions
    is exactly the guess this list refuses to make.

One correction shipped with this: the row for The Garden of Sinners: Mirai
Fukuin carried 61 minutes, which is the runtime of Gate of 7th Heaven, the
2009 recap film. Mirai Fukuin (Future Gospel, 28 September 2013) is 88
minutes in its own article AND in the film-series box's per-film list. The
figure comes from those two agreeing sources now.
