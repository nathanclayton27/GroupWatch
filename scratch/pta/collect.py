"""Collect the Paul Thomas Anderson list's source data.

    PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python scratch/pta/collect.py

One Wikipedia article is the authority — "Paul Thomas Anderson filmography" —
cached as raw wikitext under scratch/pta/cache/ so a re-run is offline and
reviewable. Each feature's own article is cached beside it, for the handful of
facts the section intros and row notes lean on.

WHAT THE ARTICLE'S "Film" SECTION ACTUALLY CONTAINS, AND WHY IT MATTERS

  * "Film > Feature films" is one wikitable. Ten rows, Hard Eight (1996) to
    One Battle After Another (2025), every one of them a bare {{Yes}} in the
    Director column. That table is the list.
  * Immediately below it, under a bolded '''Documentary''' heading, sits a
    SECOND, differently-shaped table: Year / Title / Credit, two rows — Junun
    (2015) and an unreleased Cameron Winter at Carnegie Hall with the year
    "TBA". The source files Junun outside the feature table on purpose, and
    that is the fact the shipped list's Junun decision rests on, so it is
    collected rather than remembered.
  * "Short films" (13 rows), "Miscellaneous", "Cameo and documentary
    appearances", "Television", "Stage" and "Music videos" (24 rows) are all
    collected too — not to ship them, but so the "what is not here" note can
    name them from the article instead of from anyone's memory.

RUNTIMES

From Wikidata P2047 and nothing else, each gated on a P577 publication year
within a year of the table's year so a same-titled item cannot slip a wrong
number in. Read at statement rank: see p2047() below for why gwlib's reader
is not used here.

    """The item's runtime in minutes, honouring statement rank and unit.

    gwlib.wikidata.runtime takes the longest in-range P2047 and ignores rank
    entirely, which is right for the festival-cut case it was written for and
    wrong here. Rank is Wikidata's own verdict on its own numbers: deprecated
    means "this value is wrong", preferred means "this is the one to use". A
    rank-blind reader will cheerfully ship a figure the database itself has
    struck out, and this filmography carries exactly that conflict.

    One Battle After Another is the case in full. Its item holds three P2047
    statements: 161 minutes, deprecated, reason for deprecation
    "approximation", criterion used "truncation"; 162 minutes, deprecated,
    same reason, criterion used "rounding"; and 9,691 *seconds*, rank
    preferred, reason for preferred rank "most precise value". gwlib's reader
    returns 162 — the rounded approximation the database itself struck out.

    So: deprecated statements are dropped outright, every surviving value is
    converted to minutes through TO_MINUTES (an unrecognised unit is refused,
    never assumed to be minutes), preferred rank wins over normal if any
    preferred statement survives, and only then does the longest-in-range rule
    apply among equals.

    gwlib is deliberately left alone; every other list in the catalogue is
    built on its current behaviour.
