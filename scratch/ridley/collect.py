"""Collect the Ridley Scott list's source data.

    PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python scratch/ridley/collect.py

One Wikipedia article is the spine — "Ridley Scott filmography" — cached as
raw wikitext under scratch/ridley/cache/ so a re-run is offline and reviewable.

  * "Film > Feature film" is the list. Thirty rows, every one of them a bare
    {{yes}} in the Director column.
  * "Film > Short film" is collected too, five rows, even though the shipped
    list has no shorts section: collecting them turns "no shorts" into a
    checked fact (how many of the five can be weighted at all) rather than a
    preference.
  * The As producer / As executive producer bullet lists and the Television
    and Commercials sections are collected only so the shipped "directing
    only" note can name what it leaves out from the article rather than from
    anyone's memory.

RUNTIMES, AND WHY THIS FILM-MAKER MAKES IT HARD

Runtimes come from Wikidata P2047 and from nothing else, gated on a P577
publication year within a year of the table's year. But Ridley Scott is the
alternate-cut director: Blade Runner has five released versions, Kingdom of
Heaven's director's cut runs three quarters of an hour longer than the
theatrical, Legend went out at three different lengths on two continents. So
several of these items carry more than one legitimate P2047, and picking one
takes a rule rather than a max().

gwlib.wikidata.runtime() is rank-blind and returns the longest in-range value.
Here that is wrong three separate ways, all of them present in the live data:

  * Kingdom of Heaven carries 144 qualified "applies to part: theatrical
    version" and 190 qualified "applies to part: director's cut". The longest
    is the director's cut — a different film from the one the 2005 row is
    dated by.
  * Blade Runner carries an unqualified 112 imported from de.wikipedia beside
    an unqualified 116 sourced to a film database. 112 is the PAL-speedup
    number; nothing on the statement says so.
  * Legend carries 114 qualified "director's cut" and an unqualified 125,
    which is neither of the two lengths it was released at. Its own article
    says why: "Scott's first cut of Legend ran 125 minutes long" — a cut
    nobody outside the edit suite ever saw. The longest wins there too.

So `p2047()` below reads statement rank AND the P518 "applies to part"
qualifier, and `pick_runtime()` decides between what is left:

  1. minutes only (Q7727), inside a sane band, deprecated rank dropped;
  2. preferred rank wins outright over normal, as Wikidata intends;
  3. if one distinct value survives, that is the runtime and nothing else is
     consulted. Twenty-six of the twenty-nine released features land here.
     Where such a value disagrees with the film's own article by a few
     minutes it still ships: one source, kept to, is the house rule, and
     mixing in article numbers wherever they were larger would make the total
     a blend of two different kinds of measurement;
  4. only when two or more distinct values survive is there a choice to make,
     and only then do the tie-breaks run:
       a. a value qualified "applies to part: theatrical version" wins
          outright — the row is dated by the theatrical release, so that is
          the release it is measured at (Kingdom of Heaven);
       b. otherwise CORROBORATION. The film's own article states, in its
          infobox runtime field, the length of every version it was released
          at; a value is eligible only if it lands within a minute of one of
          them. This is the article selecting among numbers Wikidata already
          carries — no number is ever typed in from the article. It is what
          drops Blade Runner's PAL-speedup 112 and Legend's never-released
          125-minute first cut;
       c. whatever is left is preferred unqualified over named-alternate-cut,
          and longest inside a bucket — the gwlib rule, correct once ranks
          and cuts have been separated out.

Every value seen, its rank, its qualifier and whether it corroborated is
recorded on the row, so the generator can assert the situation still exists
instead of trusting this docstring.

WHAT IS NOT ON THE LIST, AND HOW THE COLLECTOR PROVES IT

The Dog Stars sits in the table at 2026 and is not a shipped row: its own
article calls it upcoming and states a release date this collection ran
before, and its Wikidata item carries no P2047 at all. Both facts are
recorded (`upcoming`, `release_date`, `collected`) so the generator can
assert them rather than take anyone's word, and so the day it releases the
build fails until the row is added.
