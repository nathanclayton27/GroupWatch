Every feature Paul Thomas Anderson has directed, in release order — the ten
rows of the Feature films table in Wikipedia's "Paul Thomas Anderson
filmography", Hard Eight (1996) to One Battle After Another (2025). Every one
of those rows is a bare {{Yes}} in the Director column.

WHY THREE SECTIONS, AND WHERE THE LINES FALL

His own article names the spine: it says he is "noted for his collaborations
with the cinematographer Robert Elswit ... the composers Jon Brion and Jonny
Greenwood". Both of those collaborations end and begin at a single point in
the run, and the two points are where the sections divide. Neither line is a
mood; both are read off the infoboxes of the films themselves.

  * 1996–2002 — Elswit shot all four and the music is Brion's and Penn's.
    Hard Eight is the only row on the whole list where the filmography's own
    Producer column says No, and the only feature adapted from his own earlier
    work. Then five years with no feature.
  * 2007–2014 — Jonny Greenwood scores There Will Be Blood and has scored
    every Anderson feature since; he scored none before. Elswit shoots the
    first and the last of these three, and The Master is the one break in his
    run. Two of the three come from novels.
  * 2017–2025 — Elswit shot six of the first seven features and none of these.
    The filmography's Cinematographer column says Yes on exactly two rows,
    Phantom Thread and Licorice Pizza, and both sit here; Michael Bauman
    shares the second and shot One Battle After Another alone.

WHAT STAYS OUT

  * The 24 music videos. Not features, and — the measured half of the reason —
    not one of the 24 has a Wikidata item naming him as director, so not one
    could carry a runtime from the single source this list weighs by.
  * The 13 short films. Only three of them (The Dirk Diggler Story, Cigarettes
    & Coffee, Couch) can be weighted from that source. Three of thirteen is a
    subset, not the shorts, and an unweighted row in a weighted list is
    silently counted as an hour downstream.
  * Junun (2015). The article files it in a second, differently shaped table
    under a Documentary heading below the features, alongside an unreleased
    entry dated TBA. And the prose settles it independently of the layout: in
    the sentence immediately after the Junun paragraph the article calls
    Phantom Thread his eighth film, and Phantom Thread is the eighth row of
    the feature table. Licorice Pizza is called the ninth, One Battle After
    Another the tenth. The source counts ten, and Junun is not one of them.
  * The Miscellaneous credits — two uncredited rewrites, a stand-by directing
    job, an executive producer credit — and the television, the stage play and
    the acting cameos.

RUNTIMES

All ten from Wikidata P2047 and nothing else, each gated on a P577 publication
year within a year of the filmography's year, and read at STATEMENT RANK. That
last part is load-bearing exactly once and spectacularly: One Battle After
Another's item carries 161 minutes and 162 minutes, both deprecated as
approximations, beside a preferred 9,691 seconds marked "most precise value".
gwlib.wikidata.runtime is rank-blind and takes the longest in-range value, so
it returns 162 — the rounded figure the database itself struck out. The
collector reads rank and unit instead; gwlib is left alone, because every
other list in the catalogue is built on its current behaviour.
