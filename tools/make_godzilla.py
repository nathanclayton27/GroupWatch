    python3 tools/make_godzilla.py

Every Godzilla film from 1954 on, era by era, plus the Godzilla Fest shorts
the group asked for by name and the Monarch series as a single row.

Reads tools/data/godzilla.json, which scratch/godzilla/build.py collected
from the filmography tables of Wikipedia's Godzilla (franchise) article
("List of Godzilla films" redirects there) and from Wikidata (P2047 runtimes,
P577 release dates), with runtimes cross-checked against each film's
Wikipedia infobox. The Fest shorts have no Wikidata items and no confirmed
runtimes anywhere on Wikipedia or Wikidata, so they weigh 0 and say so.

Structure calls, stated: the Fest shorts get their own section rather than
rows inside Reiwa — minute-long web shorts interleaved between features
muddy an era list, and the group asked for them specifically. TriStar's 1998
film fits none of Toho's eras and the MonsterVerse is a different branch, so
it stands alone as a one-film section between Heisei and Millennium, which
is where it falls in release order.
