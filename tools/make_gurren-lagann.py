"""Generate properties/gurren-lagann.json — the whole 2007 run, no films.

    python3 tools/make_gurren-lagann.py

Gainax's twenty-seven-episode mecha series, April 1 to September 30, 2007, in
broadcast order, plus the one bonus episode the source's own table carries.
28 rows.

TWO FILMS EXIST AND NEITHER OF THEM IS A ROW. THIS IS THE WHOLE JOB.
Both were checked against the source rather than assumed, and the source is
unusually clear about the first and clear enough about the second:

  * ''Gurren Lagann the Movie: Childhood's End'' (September 6, 2008, 112
    minutes) — "The film is a compilation of the events of the first arc of
    the series (episodes one through fifteen) with around 20 minutes of newly
    animated scenes." That is an exact range, so main() asserts it BY RANGE
    rather than by name: the range must start at episode 1 and must stop
    short of the finale, which is what makes it a re-cut of part of this list
    rather than a thing to watch alongside it.

  * ''Gurren Lagann The Movie: The Lights in the Sky are Stars'' (April 25,
    2009, 126 minutes) — "It focuses on the second half of the series,
    contributing more new animation than the first film." More new animation
    than a compilation is still a compilation; the source never calls it a
    sequel, never says it carries story the series does not, and gives it no
    material of its own to point at.

Three further statements in the cached source say the same thing about the
pair, and all three are asserted:

  * the series article's lead: "Two [[animated film]] versions were
    produced" — versions, not sequels;
  * the production section: "Once the series ended, Yamaga had the idea of
    releasing a film that retells the events of the series to expand the
    audience"; and
  * the word "sequel" appears nowhere in the Anime films section, which
    main() asserts as a negative — if either film is ever described as one,
    this build fails rather than quietly keeping it off the list.

So both films are the same viewing as the episodes below, re-cut for cinemas.
Rowing either would count the series twice, in the row count and in the hours
if this list were weighted. They are named in the notes as an alternative way
to watch it, with their dates and lengths, which is all they are. Note also
that the second film takes its title from episode 27 — the row on this list
with that title is the episode.

THE BONUS EPISODE IS A ROW, AND IT IS OPTIONAL. The article's episode table
carries twenty-eight {{Episode list}} blocks, not twenty-seven: one is
numbered "5.5" and its own note says "This is a bonus episode bundled with
the [[Nintendo DS]] game based on the series." It is new animation rather
than a re-cut, it sits between episodes 5 and 6 where the source puts it, and
it is marked optional because it was never broadcast and is not one of the
twenty-seven. Its number is read from the raw wikitext, never through
gwlib's parsed EpisodeNumber — int() folds "5.5" into 5, which would collide
with episode 5 and silently drop a row.

THE COUNT IS ASSERTED FOUR WAYS: the list article's {{Infobox television
season}} num_episodes, the list article's own prose ("containing twenty-seven
episodes"), the series article's {{Infobox animanga/Video}} episodes field,
and the series article's lead ("It ran for 27 episodes"). Wikidata's Q4277
agrees independently with P1113 = 27, recorded by scratch/agent-gurren/hunt2.py
and asserted here from its cached result.

WEIGHTS: NONE, AND IT IS ALL-OR-NOTHING (CLU-131). The full hunt was run and
every source came up empty:

  1. no episode has its own English Wikipedia article — all 28 titles were
     asked for directly, in three forms each (bare, "(Gurren Lagann)",
     "(Gurren Lagann episode)"), and none of the 84 names resolves;
     scratch/agent-gurren/hunt.py records the answer and main() asserts it;
  2. no episode has a Wikidata item at all — nothing that is a
     television-series episode points at Q4277, and nothing anywhere in the
     series' orbit carries P2047; scratch/agent-gurren/hunt2.py records that
     and main() asserts it;
  3. neither the series article's television infobox nor the list article's
     season infobox carries a runtime field — the only `runtime =` lines on
     either page are the two films', asserted here; and
  4. not one of the twenty-eight {{Episode list}} blocks carries a RunTime.

The single duration that exists for the television run is one unqualified,
series-level P2047 of 25 minutes on Q4277 — an average, not twenty-seven
measurements. Spreading it across every row would invent precision the source
refuses to give. And it has to be every row or no row, because a row with no
`w` on a weighted list resolves to a full hour: weighting the films (112 and
126 minutes, the only lengths published anywhere) while twenty-eight episodes
had none would read as twenty-eight hours of television. Nothing carries a
weight, the films are not rows anyway, and main() asserts both.

Everything is machine-read from the cached Wikipedia wikitext in
scratch/agent-gurren/gurren-lagann/ — the episode-list article and the series
article — plus the two hunt result files beside them. Nothing is typed from
memory. Before anything is written: the parsed row count and numbering are
asserted contiguous 1..27 with exactly one 5.5; air dates are asserted
weekly-ordered and matched against both infoboxes' first/last aired; the film
table is asserted to hold exactly the two films this generator knows, in that
order, with those dates; the compilation range is asserted to start at the
first episode and stop short of the last; every exclusion the notes name —
the two Parallel Works batches, the Yoko music video, the manga, the light
novels, the spin-off manga, the DS game and the mobile game — is matched in
the source rather than remembered; and the accent pair is asserted unused by
every other property on disk.

scratch/agent-gurren/tamper.py checks the guards actually fire: it copies the
cache, rewrites one sentence at a time (the second film described as a sequel,
the compilation range widened to the whole run, an episode gaining a RunTime,
the bonus episode losing its 5.5, a third film appearing) and confirms this
generator refuses each one.
