"""Generate properties/inuyasha.json — all 193 episodes and all four films.

    python3 tools/make_inuyasha.py

Broadcast order, one row per episode, numbered 1 to 193 straight through,
with each film at the point it opened.

THE FINAL ACT IS NOT OPTIONAL, AND THE STRUCTURE SAYS SO. The 2000–04 run
stops with the manga unfinished; the 2009–10 run was made to adapt the rest.
It therefore gets a section of its own with the same standing as a season,
season four's subhead says the story does not end there, and both sections
carry an intro saying it in words. The source is unusually explicit about
its status and says two things at once, so this list quotes both rather than
picking one:

  * its own article calls it "the direct sequel to the Inuyasha anime
    series, and is based on the last 21 volumes of the manga series", and
    the episode list calls it "a sequel anime television series" that
    "adapted the final volumes of the manga" — a separate series;
  * and the same episode list carries it as the fifth block of one
    {{Series overview}}, its episode table numbers its episodes 168 to 193
    of the same run, and its infobox is an {{Infobox television season}}
    whose prev_season is Season 4 — a continuation.

Both are true and neither is optional to a viewer, which is the only thing
the page needs to get across.

THE FILMS ARE THE OTHER DECISION, and the answer is not where instinct puts
it. Three of the four opened INSIDE the television run rather than after it.
All four opened in the week before Christmas, and the series took a four- or
five-week break over each new year, so each of the first three opened in the
gap between the last episode of one December and the first of the following
January: Affections Touching Across Time eleven episodes into season two,
The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass eight into season three, Swords of an
Honorable Ruler nine into season four. Appending them after the finale — the
default a list comprehension gives you — would move the first of them past
138 episodes. Only Fire on the Mystic Island fell outside a season, three
months after the original run ended, and only it gets a section of its own.

Nothing is placed by hand. Each film is filed by comparing its release date
against every run's first and last airdate, exactly as make_babylon-5.py and
make_yuyu-hakusho.py do.

WEIGHTS: NONE, ALL OR NOTHING, and the hunt behind that is long because the
films make it tempting. All four films publish a runtime. No episode does,
and the near-misses are the interesting part:

  * no episode of either run has an article of its own — not one of the 193
    Title fields on the five episode-list articles is a wikilink;
  * no {{Episode list}} block on any of them carries a RunTime;
  * none of the four season articles has a runtime field, and the word does
    not appear on any of them, nor on The Final Act's article, nor on the
    episode list;
  * the Inuyasha (TV series) infobox has no runtime field either — the one
    match for the word on that page is a wikilink to Binary Runtime
    Environment for Wireless, a handset platform, which is exactly the trap
    a naive field read falls into and is asserted against here;
  * Wikidata does publish two figures, and they are the wrong shape. Each
    run's own item carries one blanket number for the whole run — 25 minutes
    for the original, 24 for The Final Act — which is a fact about a
    broadcast slot and not about any episode in it;
  * and Wikidata has episode items for 30 of the 193 episodes, all of them
    in the original run's first 30, with nothing at all for The Final Act.
    Every one of those 30 repeats the same 25 minutes the run's item
    carries. That is the series blanket copied down, not 30 measurements.

A weighted list resolves a row with no weight to one hour, so weighting the
four films alone would push a guessed hour into all 193 episodes. It is all
rows or none. It is none, the runtimes ride in the film row notes as text,
and main() asserts not one row carries `w`.

BLACK TESSAIGA AND YASHAHIME ARE NOT HERE. See the notes on the page.

Titles, numbering, airdates, season arc names, the one-hour specials, film
dates and runtimes, The Final Act's status sentences and the runtime census
are machine-read from Wikipedia and Wikidata by
scratch/agent-inuyasha/build_data.py; the committed result is
