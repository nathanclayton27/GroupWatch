"""Generate properties/bleach.json.

    python tools/make_bleach.py

One list of 411: the original *Bleach* run (366 episodes, 2004–2012) and its
sequel *Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War* (2022–), in broadcast order,
sectioned by arc. Wikipedia's sixteen seasons ARE the arcs — each season
article opens by naming the arc it covers — and the sequel's four Parts are
the arc divisions its own article marks.

The thing this list exists to show is the filler. Bleach's filler burden is
second only to Naruto's, and whole seasons of it are anime-original. Every row
is classified from two independent sources that have to agree:

  * animefillerlist.com's published per-episode classification, and
  * the manga chapters the Bleach wiki records each episode as adapting.

An episode both call anime-original is marked and flagged optional. An episode
they disagree about is left UNMARKED on purpose — a wrong filler label sends
someone skipping real story, and an unmarked filler episode only costs them
twenty minutes. Nothing is guessed either way, in either direction.

Both are cached, by scratch/bleach/parse.py and scratch/bleach/
fetch_chapters.py, so this generator is offline and byte-reproducible. The
counts come from the enumerated episode tables on the Wikipedia season
articles, never an infobox summary; parse.py asserts the two agree per season,
and TOTAL below asserts the whole thing, so a future desync fails the build
loudly instead of shipping a short list.

The list stops at the newest AIRED episode, the way one-piece.json does. Part 4
of the sequel is mid-run: episode 412 sits on Wikipedia's table with an air
date a week out and no title, and 413-416 sit inside an HTML comment. Raise
LAST in scratch/bleach/parse.py and re-run both scripts as it continues.

No runtimes. Nobody publishes a verified length for 411 individual episodes, so
this ships unweighted rather than repeating an invented 24 minutes 411 times
into everyone's finish date.
