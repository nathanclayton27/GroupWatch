Chapters rather than episodes, so this is the one to track if you are reading
ahead of the anime — or instead of it.

Arc chapter boundaries come from the One Pace timeline data, which lists the
manga chapters each arc covers and is the same source the One Pace property
here is built from. Made contiguous: One Pace has a few cover-story segments
that interleave with the main chapters, and every chapter belongs to exactly one
arc in a tracker.

Egghead ending at 1125 and Elbaf opening at 1126 are corroborated separately —
Egghead is widely reported as 68 chapters, and 1058-1125 is 68.

LAST is the newest released chapter. Bump it and rerun.
