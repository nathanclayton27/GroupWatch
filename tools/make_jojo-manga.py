    python tools/make_jojo-manga.py

The manga, in the Japanese tankobon volumization — one section per volume,
one row per chapter, nine parts end to end. The anime list is `jojo` and
stops at Stone Ocean; this carries on through Steel Ball Run, JoJolion and
The JoJoLands.

**The numbering restarts, and the source is what says so.** Shueisha ran the
volumes 1-63 straight through Parts 1-5; the hub article's lead states it
plainly — "After volume 63, the beginning of each Part has reset the volume
number count back at one" — and from Part 6 the volume tables print the
part's own number with the cumulative one in brackets, "1 (64)". So both
numberings are published, and neither is invented here: sections lead with
the number on the spine and carry the overall number in the sub wherever the
two differ. The chapter numbering resets with it, 1-594 across Parts 1-5 and
then from 1 again in each later part, which is why the item ids carry a
per-part prefix — one id per chapter, never two chapters sharing one.

The JoJoLands is ongoing. It stops at the last released volume, and
EXPECTED asserts that count, so the build fails when the next one ships
rather than the list quietly staying short.

Everything numeric comes from tools/data/jojo-manga.json, which
scratch/agent-jojomanga/parse.py builds from the nine Wikipedia part
articles and asserts against the articles' own counts.
