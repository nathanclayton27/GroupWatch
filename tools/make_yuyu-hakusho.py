"""Generate properties/yuyu-hakusho.json — all 112 episodes, both films, the
2018 OVA.

    python3 tools/make_yuyu-hakusho.py

Broadcast order, one row per episode, with each film at the point it went
out. THAT IS THE WHOLE DECISION HERE, and the answer is not where the
instinct puts it. Both films opened *inside* the television run, not around
it: the 1993 short went out on July 10, 1993, four and a half months into the
Dark Tournament Saga, and Poltergeist Report opened on April 9, 1994, seven
weeks into the Chapter Black Saga. Appending them after the finale — the
default a list comprehension gives you — would move them past 74 and 37
episodes respectively.

Nothing is placed by hand. Each film is filed by comparing its release date
against every season's first and last airdate, exactly as make_babylon-5.py
does, and both land inside a season rather than between two.

The tie-break is worth naming, because both films hit it. Yu Yu Hakusho aired
weekly on Saturdays and both films opened ON a broadcast Saturday — July 10,
1993 is also the airdate of episode 38, and April 9, 1994 is also the airdate
of episode 75. The source records no order within a day, so a film is placed
before the first episode that aired strictly LATER than it, which puts it
after the episode it shared a day with. main() asserts that both films
actually collide with an episode's airdate, so if a date is ever corrected
the tie-break stops being invisible.

THE ARC NAMES ARE THE SOURCE'S AND SO ARE THEIR BOUNDARIES. The list article
divides the run into four sections and names each one — Spirit Detective,
Dark Tournament, Chapter Black, Three Kings — and this list carries those
names and those boundaries unchanged. The same article is candid about what
they are: the divisions follow Funimation's North American box sets, which
"only correspond to story arcs, and not to the pattern in which the show
actually aired", because in Japan the series ran year-round with no seasons
at all. That is a caveat to print, not a reason to invent a different
division, so the page says it.

NUMBERING RUNS 1 TO 112 STRAIGHT THROUGH. The source's episode tables carry
one number per episode and it is the overall one — there is no in-season
numbering to fall back on — so season 4 opens at 95 rather than at 1.

WEIGHTS: NONE, and the hunt behind that is unusually complete because the
films make it tempting. Both films publish a runtime (30 and 95 minutes,
agreed by their infoboxes and by Wikidata P2047) and the OVA infoboxes
publish one too. The 112 episodes publish nothing, anywhere:

  * no episode has an article of its own — not one of the 112 Title fields
    is a wikilink;
  * therefore no episode has a Wikidata item to carry P2047, and asking
    Wikidata directly for everything filed as part of the series (P179, P361
    and P4908 against Q286950) returns only the four season items, none of
    which carries a runtime;
  * none of the four season articles has a runtime field, and the word does
    not appear on any of them;
  * the series article's {{Infobox television}} has no runtime field of its
    own — the two `runtime =` lines on that page belong to the two OVA
    infoboxes nested inside `related`, which is exactly the trap a naive
    field read falls into and is asserted against here;
  * and no {{Episode list}} block carries a RunTime.

A weighted list resolves a row with no weight to one hour, so weighting the
two films alone would push a guessed hour into all 112 episodes — a 112-hour
lie standing next to two honest ones. It is all rows or none. It is none, the
runtimes ride in the film and OVA row notes as text, and main() asserts not
one row carries `w`.
