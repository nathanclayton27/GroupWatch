    python3 tools/make_metalgear.py

Everything Metal Gear in release order: the saga, the side games, the remakes
and re-releases, and the on-paper extras.

Hours are HowLongToBeat main-story figures — story only, as asked — read from
tools/data/metalgear.json, which was collected from HLTB's own pages and
verified by name (the generator refuses a record whose name is not what it
expects). The extras that are not games weigh nothing rather than a guess.

Tiers are necessity, Kingdom Hearts style:
  1  the saga spine — skip it and something later will not land
  2  side stories that feed the saga: Ghost Babel, Portable Ops, Rising
  3  remakes, re-releases, spin-offs and extras

Two quirks worth knowing are in the notes: Ghost Babel shipped in the west
titled just "Metal Gear Solid", and the Master Collection's number is the
whole bundle, not a new game.
