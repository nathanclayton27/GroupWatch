"""Generate properties/time-loops.json — the group's Groundhog Day collection.

    python3 tools/make_timeloops.py

Three layers, merged:
  - the group's own Discord thread (the original 27 rows — their ids are
    load-bearing and asserted unchanged, ticks live on them)
  - Wikipedia's "List of films featuring time loops"
  - two Reddit threads the Discord recommended: r/movies' "I watched 135 time
    loop movies" (1flvzco) and r/television's loop-episode compilation
    (1ilm56j)

scratch/loops2/ holds the pipeline: collect_films.py merged and deduped the
film lists and resolved Wikidata runtimes; verify_eps.py checked every claimed
episode against Wikipedia's own episode tables before it got a row (which is
how "S15E24 Yuletide Repeat" became American Dad's S17E24 "Yule. Tide.
Repeat." and Quantum Leap's "Live, Die, Repeat" became "Leap. Die. Repeat.");
enrich_runtimes.py added runtimes for reddit-only films with a verify-by-name
gate. Provenance rides on every row as tags, so the original house list is
one chip away.
