Silent Hill in release order: the four Team Silent games, the wandering years
after them, and the revival that starts in 2023.

WHY THIS LIST STOPPED SAYING "MAINLINE ONLY"
--------------------------------------------
It shipped with a scope note reading "Mainline only", which excluded
*Silent Hill f* on the grounds that Wikipedia's Silent Hill article files it
under `=== Spin-offs ===`. The list did not follow its own rule: the same
`=== Spin-offs ===` heading also holds *The Short Message*, which was already
a row. One game admitted and another refused from the same section of the same
article is not a rule, it is a coin toss, and the note described a list that
did not exist.

The article argues with itself about *f* in four places, all of them read by
scratch/agent-sh/read_source.py:

  * structurally it is `==== ''Silent Hill f'' (2025) ====` inside Spin-offs;
  * the prose opens "A spin-off entitled ''Silent Hill f'' was announced in
    October 2022", cited to producer Motoi Okamoto, and f's own article's lead
    calls it "a standalone spin-off of the ''Silent Hill'' franchise";
  * the franchise infobox names it `latest release version` with
    `latest release date = 2025-09-25` — the newest thing the series has;
  * and the citation immediately after that prose is Polygon's, headlined
    "Silent Hill f, Konami's first main-series game in a decade, brings the
    franchise to Japan".

A source that cannot decide cannot sort this list, so the list sorts itself:
the test is whether a thing is a Silent Hill you sit down and play — a
standalone release with its own story — whatever heading it sits under. That
admits the arcade cabinet's neighbours (The Short Message, f, Townfall) and
refuses the arcade cabinet, the four mobile games, the Play Novel visual
novel, Book of Memories, P.T. and the two compilations. main() asserts the
Spin-offs section still holds all three of the entries this rule takes from
it, so a reorganised article sends the scope note back for review.

THE ONE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION: ASCENSION
---------------------------------------
*Silent Hill: Ascension* is on the list on the owner's instruction and does
not pass the rule above. Wikipedia does not file it with the games at all —
it is `=== Television ===` under Other media, "a CGI interactive television
series" broadcast nightly from October 31, 2023 to April 24, 2024, whose
audience voted on the story. Its row says so in as many words, and main()
asserts the article still files it under Television so the exception cannot
quietly become untrue. It is weighted because HowLongToBeat does carry a
main-story figure for it.

UNRELEASED WORK IS LISTED WHEN THE SOURCE DATES IT, AND WEIGHS ZERO
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The owner's rule: announced with a release date — even a bare year — is
enough to earn a row; undated work is not. So:

  * *Silent Hill: Townfall* is a row. Its own article's infobox reads
    `released = September 24, 2026`, its lead "It is scheduled to release for
    PlayStation 5 and Windows on September 24, 2026", and its short
    description "Upcoming 2026 video game".
  * The remake of the first game is NOT a row. It is announced (June 2025,
    Bloober Team) with no date anywhere: the release timeline slots it under
    `TBA`, its heading reads `''Silent Hill'' (TBA)`, its paragraph gives no
    date, and it has no article of its own. main() asserts all three, so the
    day Wikipedia dates it the build fails and it comes back for review.

An unreleased row carries an explicit `w: 0`, never a missing `w`. The page
resolves `WEIGHT = x.w >= 0 ? x.w : 1`, so a row without one on a weighted
list silently books itself as one hour (CLU-131) — an invented hour for a
game nobody can have played. Zero is the honest figure and it keeps the other
twelve rows' verified HowLongToBeat hours intact.

The release date is asserted every run, against the clock:

  * while it is in the future, the row weighs 0, its note says when the game
    is due, and the source is asserted to still call it upcoming — if the
    article starts describing it as released, the build fails;
  * the day it passes, the build fails unless tools/data/silent-hill.json has
    a name-gated HowLongToBeat record for it. Re-run
    scratch/agent-sh/fetch_hltb.py and the row weights itself. It cannot
    quietly stay at zero, and it cannot quietly become a phantom hour.

SOURCES
-------
Every fact on the card is machine-read. Game list, years and how the article
files each entry: Wikipedia's Silent Hill, Silent Hill f and Silent Hill:
Townfall articles, parsed by scratch/agent-sh/read_source.py into the
"_source" block of tools/data/silent-hill.json. Hours: HowLongToBeat
main-story figures collected by scratch/agent-sh/fetch_hltb.py through
gwlib.hltb.story_hours(), which refuses a record whose name is not what was
asked for; this generator re-checks each record's name and year before
believing it (the 2024 remake shares the 2001 game's name on HowLongToBeat
and is told apart by year).

TIERS: 1 is the essential path — Silent Hill 1 through 4, the 2024 remake and
Silent Hill f, which is a full-size current entry rather than a side trip
however the article files it. 2 is everything else.
