Twenty games and six films, in release order, 1987 to October 2026. Every
fact below is read out of tools/data/street-fighter.json, collected by
scratch/agent-sf/collect.py from Wikipedia wikitext, Wikidata and
HowLongToBeat. Nothing is typed from memory; the asserts re-check every claim
the prose makes, and the sentences the notes paraphrase are stored whole so a
Wikipedia edit that removes one fails this file instead of quietly outliving
it.

WHAT COUNTS AS ONE GAME
-----------------------
This is the whole editorial question on a Street Fighter list, and it is not
close to arbitrary — the source answers it, in words, twice over.

The rule shipped here: **a row is a game Wikipedia documents in an article of
its own, inside the franchise's Main series.** Ports, bundled re-releases and
free updates the source folds into another game's article are not rows;
compilations that box up games already on this list are not rows either.

That rule is not mine. Both halves come off the page:

  * `List of Street Fighter video games` splits itself into "Main series"
    and "Other games", and says of the second: "These games are not part of
    the mainline Street Fighter series, but involve Street Fighter
    characters." The roster below is every Street Fighter game linked from
    the first section. Twenty of them.
  * Wikipedia NUMBERS the Street Fighter II versions, in their own leads, and
    the count runs to eight:

        Champion Edition   "the first of several updated versions of
                           Street Fighter II: The World Warrior (1991)"
        Hyper Fighting     "the third arcade version of Street Fighter II"
        Super SFII         "the fourth game in the Street Fighter II
                           sub-series of Street Fighter games"
        Super SFII Turbo   "the fifth installment in the Street Fighter II
                           sub-series"
        Hyper SFII         a port "in which players can control any versions
                           of the main characters from the five Street
                           Fighter II games previously released"
        HD Remix           "designed ... to be the sixth definitive version
                           of Street Fighter II, although it is in fact the
                           seventh"
        Ultra SFII         "the eighth definitive version of the game"

    One, three, four, five, seventh, eighth, and the two that fill the gaps.
    A source that counts to eight is not describing one game with revisions.
    So Street Fighter II is eight rows, and the notes say so on the page.

The same rule cuts the other way at the modern end, which is what makes it a
rule rather than a preference. `Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition`,
`Street Fighter V: Champion Edition`, `Ultra Street Fighter IV`,
`Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition` and `Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2
Fighters Edition` are all named in the same list article — and every one of
them is a redirect into another game's article, or not a link at all. Nobody
sits down to play Street Fighter V and then separately plays Champion
Edition; the source knows that and files it accordingly. Champion Edition
(1992) was a coin-op you had to find a different cabinet for, and the source
knows that too.

Length was not a reason to go either way: zombie-films ships 605 rows.

THE SUB-SERIES QUESTIONS, EACH ANSWERED BY THE SOURCE
-----------------------------------------------------
  Alpha / Zero       IN, one row per numbered game. `List of Street Fighter
                     video games` files the Alpha series under Main series,
                     and the franchise article's lead counts "the other six
                     main games in the series" — Street Fighter plus six is
                     II, Alpha, III, IV, V and 6. `Zero` is the same games'
                     Japanese title, not other games, so it is a note and not
                     a row. (`List of Street Fighter media` disagrees and
                     files Alpha under spin-offs; the video-games list is the
                     franchise article's own {{Main}} link and matches its
                     section headings, so it wins.)
  EX 1/2/3           OUT. Not a close call and not my call: the same list
                     article files EX under "Other games", the section that
                     opens "These games are not part of the mainline Street
                     Fighter series". The franchise article agrees — "Capcom
                     co-produced a 3D fighting game Street Fighter EX with
                     Arika" — and Arika owns half that cast, which is why
                     those characters ended up in Fighting EX Layer instead.
  Marvel vs. Capcom  OUT, with SNK vs. Capcom, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom,
  and the crossovers Street Fighter X Tekken, X-Men vs. Street Fighter and
                     Capcom Fighting Evolution — all under "Other games".
                     They are crossovers with their own franchises attached;
                     Marvel vs. Capcom is somebody else's list.
  Final Fight        OUT, and it is the interesting one. The franchise
                     article says Street Fighter II came "following an
                     unsuccessful attempt to brand the 1989 beat 'em up game
                     Final Fight as the Street Fighter sequel", and the list
                     article says the series was "originally intended as
                     direct sequel to the original Street Fighter". The
                     attempt failed, Street Fighter II is the sequel, and
                     Final Fight sits under "Other games" — a beat 'em up
                     that shares a city, not a fighting game that shares a
                     line.
  Compilations       OUT: Street Fighter Collection, the Anniversary
                     Collection, Alpha Anthology and the 30th Anniversary
                     Collection are boxes holding rows that are already here.
  The 1995 tie-ins   OUT. The two `Street Fighter: The Movie` fighting games
                     are in "Other games" too.

WHAT COUNTS AS ONE FILM
-----------------------
The mirror of the same doctrine: **a film is a work Wikipedia files with
{{Infobox film}} in an article of its own.** Six qualify, and the test does
real work at both edges.

  in    Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie (1994), Street Fighter (1994),
        Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation (2000), Street Fighter Alpha:
        Generations (2005), Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li (2009),
        Street Fighter (2026).
  out   Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind — `List of Street Fighter
        media` lists it under Films, but its "article" is a section of the
        Street Fighter IV page. Street Fighter: Round One: Fight! is listed
        there too and is a red link.
  out   TELEVISION, all of it. Street Fighter II V (1995) and the American
        cartoon (1995-97) are in that same media list's own
        ===Television series=== section; Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist
        (2014) and Street Fighter: Resurrection (2016) carry
        {{Infobox television}} and describe themselves as web series, whatever
        section they are filed under. Nathan asked for the games and the
        films. Keeping television off is also what keeps the sync medium
        honest — see below, there is no letter for it.

A live-action film IS a row at the end: Wikipedia gives the 2026 one a date,
"scheduled to be released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on
October 16, 2026 in IMAX", and dated announced work ships as a row under
Nathan's rule of 2026-08-26. Undated work stays off, and nothing here is
undated.

THE ROW MEDIUM, WHICH THIS LIST CANNOT DO WITHOUT
--------------------------------------------------
build.py groups cross-list ticks by a medium letter and used to derive it
from the property's kind string. On a "films & games" list that put every
row, films included, in the game lane — the-matrix lost five pairings to it
before anyone noticed. A row may now declare "m", and the kind is only a
fallback. On THIS list the fallback would be "g" for all twenty-six rows, so
every row here carries its own letter: "f" on the six films, "g" on the
twenty games. The assert below refuses to emit a row without one.

WEIGHTS: THIS LIST SHIPS UNWEIGHTED, AND THAT IS THE FINDING
-------------------------------------------------------------
HowLongToBeat has a main-story figure for all twenty games. They were all
fetched, they are all in tools/data/street-fighter.json, and they are not
used, because a number existing is not a number meaning something.

  * Nineteen of the twenty measure one run up an arcade ladder: 0.68 h for
    Street Fighter Alpha, 1.66 h for Super Street Fighter II Turbo. Nobody
    has ever finished Super Turbo in an hour and three quarters. The figure
    describes the credits roll, not the game — and Super Turbo is a game
    people have been playing for thirty years.
  * The twentieth is Street Fighter 6 at 17.34 h, and that one is real:
    World Tour is "a single-player story mode featuring a customizable
    player avatar exploring 3D environments". It is a different quantity
    wearing the same label. Weighted, one row would own a third of the whole
    bar, and the page would say something false in its most visible place.
  * The figures contradict each other on the same fights. Hyper Street
    Fighter II is a port of Super Turbo with a version selector bolted on;
    HowLongToBeat says 2.23 h against Super Turbo's 1.66 h. That gap is
    sampling noise, and a bar drawn from it would render the noise as fact.
  * Four of the twenty only answer to a title HowLongToBeat spells its own
    way, and 3rd Strike returns nothing at all under the name Wikipedia
    uses.

And the films would land among them: 1.7 h for the 1994 movie, sitting
indistinguishably beside a 1.66 h "playthrough" of Super Turbo, implying the
two are the same size of commitment.

All-or-nothing (CLU-131): a row with no `w` on a WEIGHTED list is silently
worth one hour, so there is no half-measure available — weight the films and
the list lies about the games. Unweighted, every row weighs 1, TOTALW ==
TOTAL, and the counters say "8 / 26", which is exactly the true statement
this list can make. The assert below refuses ANY `w`, including a `w: 0` on
the 2026 film: the front end turns weighting on when a single row carries a
number, and one zero would put "25 hours" on a page that measures nothing.

ORDER
-----
Release order, and the source supplies it twice. Each game's first release
date comes from its own infobox, and the resulting sequence is checked
against the {{Timeline of release years}} in `List of Street Fighter video
games`, whose 1992a/1992b/1997a/1997d/2008a/2008b/2010a/2010b keys settle
every within-year tie the same way. Films are placed by their own infobox
release dates, which is how the two 1994 films land after Super Turbo and in
the right order relative to each other.
