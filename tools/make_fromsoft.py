    python3 tools/make_fromsoft.py

The Souls line and its adjacents, in release order: Demon's Souls through
Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree as its own row (it is the size of a full
game), Nightreign, and Armored Core VI as a marked outlier. Not the whole
studio — no King's Field, no older Armored Core.

Which games exist and their release years come from Wikipedia's FromSoftware
article (scratch/fromsoft/games.wiki — its developed-games and DLC tables).
Hours are HowLongToBeat main-story figures — story only, the house rule —
read from tools/data/fromsoft.json, collected by
scratch/fromsoft/fetch_hltb.py and verified by name (this generator refuses a
record whose name is not what it expects, and cross-checks HLTB's release
year against Wikipedia's).

Tiers, and the rule behind them:
  1  the Souls line proper — the seven complete games, Demon's Souls to
     Elden Ring
  2  what extends Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree and Nightreign
  3  the outlier — Armored Core VI, same studio, not Souls

Dark Souls: Remastered (2018) and the Demon's Souls remake (2020) are the
same stories in better clothes; they are notes on their rows, not rows.
