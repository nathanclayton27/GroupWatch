Sixty-three entries: the two television seasons, the optional side story, and
the three works of the film continuity — in release order, with every fork
named on the section that forks.

THE FORK, AND WHY THIS LIST REFUSES TO PICK A SIDE
--------------------------------------------------
Code Geass is two stories wearing one name, and a list that hides that lies
to whoever reads it. The 2017–18 trilogy is a compilation of the television
series, but not a faithful one — the trilogy article quotes its own director
saying "while the films are recap of the television series, there are few
changes to the storylines". Those changes are load-bearing. The 2019 film
''Lelouch of the Re;surrection'' is written as a sequel to the FILMS:

    "Lelouch of the Re;surrection takes place in the continuation of the
     series that was first depicted in the three-part compilation film:
     Initiation, Transgression, and Glorification, which was released
     between 2017 and 2018, and serves as a direct sequel to the events of
     the three-part film."

and the 2024 four-part ''Rozé of the Recapture'' article says so even more
bluntly, calling Re;surrection a film "which itself takes place in an
alternate continuity established in the three-part compilation film".

So somebody who watches the fifty television episodes and then reaches for
Re;surrection has changed continuity mid-story without being told. That is
the exact reader this list exists for. Following make_slashers.py, which had
to hold five mutually exclusive Halloween timelines in one list, the answer
is: order by RELEASE — the one order nobody disputes — explain the split in
the section intros, flag it factually on the rows that start or end a
continuity, and never render one route as the correct one. There is no tier
column here for the same reason: a tier would rank the two routes.

Release order happens to keep each continuity contiguous, which is luck
worth stating rather than engineering: television 2006–2016, films 2017–2024.

AKITO THE EXILED IS IN, AND OPTIONAL
------------------------------------
The brief was to include it only if the source treats it as part of the same
work. It does, three times over: the franchise article gives it its own
subsection under Media → Anime, states that "Along with the two seasons of
the television series, the OVAs are licensed by Funimation", and places it
inside the television story's own timeline — "set in Europe during the
Britannian invasion of the continent between Lelouch of the Rebellion's two
seasons". Its own article calls it a spin-off. So it is a section, marked
optional on every row, sitting at its release position with the intro saying
where the source puts it in the story.

WEIGHTS: NONE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT
------------------------------------------
An unweighted row on a weighted list silently counts as one hour (CLU-131),
so weighting is all-or-nothing. The eight films publish runtimes; the fifty
television episodes and the five OVA episodes do not — the collector records
every RunTime/Length/Duration field it can find in either season article and
finds none, and this build asserts that. Weighting the films and leaving the
episodes bare would have invented fifty hours; applying a series-level
average per episode would have invented a source. So nothing carries `w`,
every mark is one entry, and the film runtimes live in the row notes where
they inform without pretending to measure.
