"""Generate properties/frieren.json — both aired seasons, every episode.

    PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python tools/make_frieren.py

Madhouse's adaptation of Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe's manga. 38 rows:
28 episodes of season 1 (September 2023 to March 2024) and 10 of season 2
(January to March 2026), in broadcast order, read from Wikipedia's
"List of Frieren episodes" article.

THE SECOND SEASON HAS ALREADY AIRED, IN FULL. That is a fact taken from the
source, not assumed from the announcement: the article's own {{Series
overview}} gives season 2 `episodes2 = 10`, `start2 = 2026-01-16` and — the
part that settles it — `end2 = 2026-03-27`, an {{End date}} rather than an
open run. Every one of the ten episodes parses with an airdate on or before
TODAY, which main() asserts row by row. So the season is listed in full and
this list is not a broadcast tracker.

WHICH IS WHY THERE IS NO `schedule` BLOCK. The house treatment for a
currently-running season is one dated window per episode (president-curtis
and lanterns both do it, and both were mid-run when they shipped). It is the
right shape only while a season is actually airing: the pace line then reads
"are you caught up with the broadcast". Season 2 closed on 27 March 2026,
five months before this was built, and season 3 does not premiere until
October 2027 with no per-episode dates published. Windows here would pace a
club against a broadcast that finished, so there are none.

SEASON 3 IS ANNOUNCED AND IS NOT LISTED, WITH A TRIPWIRE. The source carries
it as `start3 = {{Start date|2027|10}}` with `episodes3` EMPTY, no episode
table, and no `=== Season 3 ===` heading; the series article says it covers
the "Golden Land" arc and was announced after season 2's finale. Nothing
about it can be listed, because the source publishes no episode. main()
therefore asserts all three of those absences and asserts the announced
premiere is still in the future — the day Wikipedia starts filling season 3
in, this generator fails loudly instead of quietly shipping a list that has
gone short.

THE SHORTS ARE A DIFFERENT SERIES. "Frieren: Beyond Journey's End – Spell
That Does OOO" is a run of short episodes with its own seasons and its own
numbering, filed under its own level-2 heading on the same article. It is
not part of the television series' 38 and is not listed; the section
boundary is where this generator stops reading, and main() asserts that
heading is still there so the cut cannot silently swallow real episodes.

WEIGHTS: NONE, AND THE SOURCE IS THE REASON. Wikipedia documents exactly one
running time for this show — `runtime = 24 minutes` on the series infobox,
a series-level figure — and none whatsoever per episode: no episode entry in
either season carries a Runtime field, which main() asserts for all 38.
Wikidata does not rescue it; the series item (Q115792176) holds TWO
unqualified, equal-rank P2047 durations, 24 minutes and 25 minutes, with
nothing to choose between them. Spreading a series average over 38 rows
would invent precision the source refuses to give, and the two-hour
four-episode premiere is proof that a flat per-episode number is not what
happened. It is all rows or none, because a row with no `w` on a weighted
list silently counts as one hour and a part-weighted list reads worse than
an unweighted one. It is none; main() asserts no row carries a weight.

Everything is machine-read from the cached Wikipedia wikitext — the episode
list article and the series article. Nothing is typed from memory. Before
anything is written: each season's parsed row count is asserted against the
list article's {{Series overview}}; each season's in-season numbering is
asserted to run 1..N and the overall numbering to run 1..38 unbroken; the
overall total is cross-checked against the series infobox's num_episodes and
num_seasons; airdates are asserted non-decreasing, asserted to match the
overview's start/end dates for each season, and asserted to be in the past;
and the accent pair is asserted unused by every other property on disk.
