The Castlevania canon in three styles: the classic whip-and-stairs games,
Symphony of the Night and the six handheld Metroidvanias that followed it,
and the Lords of Shadow reboot as its own optional wing.

Which games exist and their release years come from Wikipedia's Castlevania
article — its main-series release timeline is the authority
(scratch/agent-games1/wiki/castlevania.wiki). Hours are HowLongToBeat
main-story figures — story only, the house standard — read from
tools/data/castlevania.json, collected by
scratch/agent-games1/fetch_hltb.py and verified by name (this generator
refuses a record whose name is not what it expects, and cross-checks HLTB's
release year against Wikipedia's).

Every row carries a style tag — Classic, Metroidvania, Reboot — and the
page grows filter chips from them.

Scope cut, stated: the Game Boy trilogy (The Adventure, Belmont's Revenge,
Legends), the Nintendo 64 pair, the PS2 3D pair (Lament of Innocence, Curse
of Darkness), Dracula X on SNES, Haunted Castle and the spin-offs are on
Wikipedia's timeline but not here — this list keeps to the canon the series
is remembered for. The notes say so.
