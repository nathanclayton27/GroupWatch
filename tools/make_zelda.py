The Legend of Zelda in release order: the mainline 21 from the 1986 original
through Echoes of Wisdom, plus the remakes and spin-offs worth a row, marked
as such.

Which games exist and their release years come from Wikipedia's "List of The
Legend of Zelda media" (scratch/zelda/media.wiki). Hours are HowLongToBeat
main-story figures — story only, the house rule — read from
tools/data/zelda.json, collected by scratch/zelda/fetch_hltb.py and verified
by name (this generator refuses a record whose name is not what it expects,
and cross-checks HLTB's release year against Wikipedia's).

Tiers are necessity, stated judgment:
  1  the console 3D line (Ocarina through Tears) plus the 2D pillars that
     built it: the original, A Link to the Past, Link's Awakening
  2  the rest of mainline 2D — the DS pair included
  3  spin-offs and remakes, each marked for what it is

One honest fudge: Four Swords shipped in 2002 only as the second half of a
Game Boy Advance cart with A Link to the Past, and HLTB has no entry for that
release on its own. The row sits at 2002 where the game belongs, and its
hours are the name-verified Four Swords Anniversary Edition — the 2011 DSi
standalone of the same game. The row's note says so.
