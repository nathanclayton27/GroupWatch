    python tools/make_zombies.py

Every feature on Wikipedia's List of zombie films that has its own article,
era sections from White Zombie to the streaming wave. The bare-text entries
on the source list have no article to verify against and stay out — the same
cut the body-swap list made. Shorts live on Wikipedia's separate shorts list
and are out of scope. Unweighted grab bag: director and runtime ride on the
notes, the random picker is the front door.

Data: scratch/zombies/collect.py -> tools/data/zombie-films.json
(title/page/year/director from the list's table, runtimes Wikidata P2047).
