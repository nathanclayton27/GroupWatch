Every game with Mega Man on the box, scoped by one source the owner picked:
"the mega man compendium" on Backloggd (backloggd.com/u/ade/list/
the-mega-man-compendium-/), a 94-game list whose own description is "every
mega man game ever sorted by release date". Contents and order are its call,
not this file's — including the Chinese licensed PC releases and the Japanese
feature-phone toys that no franchise summary bothers with.

Two things the source does not settle, settled here and said out loud:

  * It has no sections. It is one flat grid sorted by release date, and its
    site offers the same 94 under six other sorts. The sections below read
    each title's own sub-series off its name — Classic, X, Legends, Battle
    Network, Zero, ZX, Star Force — with the Classic-universe odd jobs and
    the one crossover in a last section. Inside every section the order is
    the compendium's own: release date, oldest first.
  * It carries no years or lengths. Years come from each game's own Backloggd
    page; the roster those pages produced is distilled into
    tools/data/megaman-compendium.json, which is what this reads — the raw
    page cache stays out of the repo, and the generator no longer depends on
    an untracked scratch directory to run. Hours are HowLongToBeat
    main-story figures behind tools/gwlib/hltb.py's verify-by-name gate,
    collected by scratch/megaman/fetch_hltb.py into tools/data/megaman.json.

Anything the gate refused ships UNWEIGHTED, and the reason is kept in the
data file rather than replaced with a guess: HowLongToBeat has never heard of
most of the feature-phone games, and a made-up number would go straight into
a reader's pace. Unweighted rows count as an hour apiece to the page's
arithmetic, which is the floor, not a claim.

The compendium advertises "94 Games" and enumerates 94. Both numbers are
asserted below; if the list ever grows and only one of them moves, this
build fails rather than quietly shipping the wrong count.
