"""Generate properties/x-men.json — the comprehensive X-Men reading list.

    python3 tools/make_xmen.py

The spine is the two flagship lineages, every issue rowed:

  X-Men (1963) #1-544        which becomes Uncanny X-Men and runs to 2011
  X-Men (1991) #1-275        which becomes New X-Men at #114, X-Men again at
                             #157, and X-Men Legacy at #208

From 1991 to 2001 the two flagships ran in lockstep — 113 issues each, ending
together — so they are read in pairs, each month's Uncanny then its X-Men. The
same pairing carries 2004-2008 (Uncanny #444-494 against X-Men #157-207, again
equal) and 2008-2011 (Uncanny #500+ against Legacy).

Cross-title chapters follow the house rule: spliced in at the point they are
read, as ◆ rows sized by how many issues they are, never appended at the end.
The 2011-2019 era is deliberately one row per run rather than per issue — the
line fragmented into a dozen titles and no one reads it straight through — and
the notes say so.

Series links resolve against tools/data/marvel_series_index.json and the build
fails on a slug that is not in it. Notes say what an issue IS — a debut, a
creator boundary, an arc name — never what happens in it.
