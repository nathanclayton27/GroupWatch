The whole Persona franchise in release order: the six mainline RPGs, the
expanded editions that are different enough from their originals to be a
second sitting, the Persona 3 remake, and every spin-off — the fighting
games, the two Persona Q crawlers, the three rhythm games, Strikers, Tactica
and the mobile Phantom X.

Where the roster came from
--------------------------
Wikipedia's "Persona (series)" article, and specifically its {{Video game
timeline}} — the franchise's own release list, which bolds the main series and
leaves everything else plain. scratch/persona/parse_wiki.py reads that
timeline, follows every link to the game's own article, and takes the release
year off its infobox; on all 22 released-or-dated entries the timeline's slot
and the article's own earliest release year agree exactly, which is what makes
the year safe to assert rather than approximate. The parsed roster is baked
into tools/data/persona.json by scratch/persona/fetch_hltb.py — `slot`,
`main_series`, `wiki_year` and `wiki_years` are Wikipedia's, not
HowLongToBeat's, and every one of them is re-asserted below.

Nothing on this page is typed from memory. Titles, years, release order and
the mainline/spin-off split are all read from that timeline; hours are read
from HowLongToBeat; and this file re-states each fact independently and fails
if the data disagrees with it.

Hours
-----
HowLongToBeat main-story figures through tools/gwlib/hltb.py's verify-by-name
gate. Collection ran with `year_slack=0` and this file re-asserts the exact
year on every row: a same-title-different-year match is how two shipped lists
picked up wrong runtimes (CLU-178), and this franchise is a minefield for it —
a bare search for "Persona 3" returns Reload, Portable, FES, Episode Aigis and
a rhythm game before it returns Persona 3. The `howlongtobeatpy` package is
dead and must not be reintroduced; gwlib speaks the live protocol (CLU-130).

One row's HowLongToBeat year is not its first-release year, and it is declared
rather than tolerated: Persona 4 Arena Ultimax reached Japanese arcades in
2013 and consoles worldwide in 2014, and the site times the console release.
The gate still ran at zero slack — against 2014 — and this file asserts that
2014 is a year Wikipedia actually lists for that game. That is the difference
between naming an exception and widening a window.

Every row carries a real `w`. That is not decoration: the page computes
`WEIGHT = x.w >= 0 ? x.w : 1`, so one missing weight on a weighted list
silently books a 60-hour dungeon crawler as an hour, on a list whose entire
point is that the hours are honest. There is no unweighted row here and no
mechanism below to produce one — a row whose figure fails the gate fails the
build instead.

The seven rows this list shipped with keep their ids AND their figures.
Ids are permanent: renaming one silently orphans everybody's ticks. The
figures are frozen for a softer reason — people have a pace schedule against
this list, and moving Persona 3 by a tenth of an hour to no purpose is churn.
scratch/persona/fetch_hltb.py records what today's fetch said beside each
frozen figure, so the freeze is visible rather than invisible.

The four calls, made deliberately
---------------------------------
**Expanded editions: folded where the data says fold, split where it says
split.** FES, Portable, Golden and Royal are not sequels; they are the same
game with more in it, and properties/halo.json folds Anniversary into Combat
Evolved while properties/gears-of-war.json folds Ultimate Edition into the
2006 original. Both of those assert the fold rather than assuming it — the
remaster has to time within three hours of the original — and the same test
runs here, on all four, in both directions. Exactly one passes. *FES* comes in
within two hours of Persona 3, because HowLongToBeat files *The Answer*, the
28-hour epilogue FES added, as a separate record; so FES ticks the Persona 3
row and is named in its note. *Portable*, *Golden* and *Royal* all miss by
more than three hours — Portable by eighteen — so each gets its own optional
row rather than a claim the data will not support. Royal misses by under an
hour of slack and the split rests on that margin, which is precisely why the
assertion is written both ways: if the site's figures ever converge, this
build fails and the call gets made again instead of quietly staying wrong.

**Everything that is not mainline is optional.** Wikipedia's timeline bolds
six released games; those six are the only rows here without `opt`, and this
file asserts that correspondence row by row rather than trusting itself to
have marked them by hand. The reason is the headline total: someone who plays
the six has played Persona in the sense that matters, and an optional row
stays out of the pace maths, so adding thirteen spin-offs and editions does
not silently rewrite what "finishing" means for people already ticking this
list. Persona 3 Reload was already optional for the same reason and stays
where it was.

**The blurb computes its own numbers.** Five lists in this catalogue shipped a
blurb that contradicted the card printed directly above it (CLU-190), and the
one this list had — "7 games and about 431 hours" — was about to become the
sixth. Every number in the new one is summed from the weights at build time,
so an added row moves the sentence with it. The row count is left to the card,
which generates one; what the blurb states is the mainline count, which is a
different and explicitly labelled number.

**Live and dead spin-offs are treated differently.** *Persona 5: The Phantom
X* is a free-to-play mobile game still adding story, and it ships, marked
optional, with its note saying so — HowLongToBeat times it and it can be
played today. The Japan-only mobile and browser games Wikipedia describes in
prose but leaves off its timeline — *The Night Before*, *Ain Soph*, *Persona
Mobile Online*, the *Persona 3* phone side-stories, *Persona 4 The Card
Battle* — are cut: their servers are off and there is nothing left to play,
which is the rule properties/fps-canon.json uses for dead live-service
shooters and the one gears-of-war.json uses to cut Gears Pop!.

**The two unreleased games are excluded, and the exclusion is asserted.**
Persona 4 Revival (18 February 2027) and Persona 6 both have HowLongToBeat
records with no main-story figure, and this file asserts that stays true. The
day the site starts timing either, this build fails and someone adds the row,
rather than the list quietly staying a game short.

Tiers
-----
  1  the modern trilogy — 3, 4, 5, what everyone means by "Persona"
  2  the PS1 classics — the original and the Persona 2 duology
  3  everything optional — the editions, the Reload retelling, the spin-offs

Three is the ceiling, not a choice: the page's stats bar is built for tiers 1
to 3 (`TIERTOT = {1:0,2:0,3:0}` in src/template.html) and a fourth would count
into an undefined slot.
