"""Generate properties/outlaw-star.json — the complete 26-episode run.

    python tools/make_outlaw-star.py

Sunrise's 1998 space western, every episode, in the order the show numbers
them. One season, 26 rows, finished: TV Tokyo ran it from January 8 to
June 25, 1998 and nothing continued it. Titles, airdates and Toonami dates are
machine-read from Wikipedia's "List of Outlaw Star episodes" by
scratch/agent-outlaw/harvest.py; the committed result is
tools/data/outlaw-star.json and everything below is asserted against it.

TWO EPISODES HAVE BROADCAST HISTORIES WORTH A ROW NOTE, IN OPPOSITE
DIRECTIONS, AND BOTH ARE READ FROM THE SOURCE RATHER THAN REMEMBERED.

  * Episode 16, "Demon of the Water Planet", has no Japanese airdate at all —
    its OriginalAirDate field is the literal string "Not aired". The other 25
    went out weekly with no gap, which is what makes the missing slot a
    missing EPISODE and not a missing week, and main() asserts exactly that:
    25 distinct dates, seven days apart, unbroken. Toonami ran it in its
    numbered position, so English-speaking viewers saw it first. It is a row
    because it is an episode of the show.
  * Episode 23, "Hot Springs Planet Tenrei", is the reverse: it aired in Japan
    and was pulled from the 2001 Toonami run, reaching the West only when the
    revived block ran it seventeen years later. The list follows the Japanese
    broadcast, so it sits in its numbered place.

ANGEL LINKS IS OUT, AND NAMED. The franchise's one spin-off is a separate
13-episode Sunrise series that ran on Wowow in 1999. The main article files it
under "Spin-off" in the infobox — main() asserts that block still names it and
nothing else — and settles the scope question in one sentence, quoted in the
notes: "Outlaw Star and Angel Links take place in the same universe;
characters from both series appeared in an episode of Outlaw Star, but the two
have little else in relation." A shared setting is not a shared story, so it
is not a continuation of this list. The crossover the sentence refers to is
episode 19, "Law and Lawlessness" — Angel Links' own article names that
episode as where Duuz and Valeria debuted, and main() asserts the title it
names is one of the 26 parsed here, so the row note pointing at the spin-off
cannot drift onto the wrong episode.

THERE IS NO OVA AND NO FILM. A single-episode sequel was drafted and never
animated; the source's words are "Preliminary plans were made to create a
direct sequel in the form of a single-episode (OVA) called Sword of Wind, but
production never began." An unmade episode cannot be watched, so it is named
in the notes rather than listed. The manga and the light novels are print and
out of scope for a watch list; the manga has no official English release at
all, which main() asserts along with its chapter count.

NOTHING IS WEIGHTED, AND THE HUNT WAS EXHAUSTIVE. Weighting is all-or-nothing
— a row with no `w` silently counts as one hour — so a partial set of runtimes
would be worse than none. Every place a per-episode duration could live was
checked by scratch/agent-outlaw/runtimes.py and every one came up empty:
none of the 26 {{Episode list}} blocks has a RunTime or Aux field; no episode
has a Wikipedia article of its own (all 20 episode-title pages are redirects
to the list, and not one Title field is a wikilink); no episode has a Wikidata
item (nothing carries P179/P361/P4908/P1811 = Q2470001, and the series item
declares no parts); neither the series item nor the episode-list item carries
P2047, and the series item has no P2047 statement at all; there is no season
article; and the main article states no running time in prose. main() asserts
all eight of those zeroes before it will build, so the day the source grows a
runtime this generator stops rather than shipping a stale claim.

CROSS-LIST TICK SYNC DOES NOT APPLY. src/build.py syncs film-kind and
game-kind rows only, and this list's kind is "anime" — main() asserts the kind
contains neither word. Belt and braces, it also asserts no row note contains a
bare four-digit year, because build.py's `_year_of` falls back to reading one
out of a note when `n` is not a year, and every `n` here is an episode number.
