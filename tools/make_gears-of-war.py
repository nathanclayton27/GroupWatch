The Gears of War campaigns in release order — the 2006 original through
Gears 5 and its Hivebusters expansion — cut into the two eras the franchise
actually has: Epic Games on the Xbox 360, then The Coalition under Microsoft.
Spin-offs and expansions ride in release order alongside the numbered games
rather than being hidden in a section of their own, and carry `opt: 1`, which
is the shape properties/halo.json already uses for the two Halo Wars games.

Where the roster came from
--------------------------
Wikipedia's "Gears of War" article, cached at
scratch/gears-of-war/wiki/Gears-of-War.wiki, and specifically its {{VG
timeline}} — the franchise's own release list, which bolds the main series
and leaves the spin-offs plain:

    2006 Gears of War · 2008 Gears of War 2 · 2011 Gears of War 3 ·
    2013 Judgment · 2015 Ultimate Edition · 2016 Gears of War 4 ·
    2019 Gears Pop! · 2019 Gears 5 · 2020 Gears Tactics ·
    2025 Reloaded · 2026 E-Day

Release dates below are each game's own Wikipedia article, cached in the same
directory; they are in the roster because "release order" is a claim this file
asserts rather than an ordering it assumes. Two years hold two entries each
(2011, 2020) and sorting by year alone would leave the order to luck.

Hours
-----
HowLongToBeat main-story figures through tools/gwlib/hltb.py's verify-by-name
gate, collected by scratch/gears-of-war/fetch_hltb.py into
tools/data/gears-of-war.json. Collection ran with `year_slack=0` and this file
re-asserts the exact year on every row: a same-title-different-year match is
how two shipped lists picked up wrong runtimes (CLU-178), and this franchise
is a minefield for it — the 2006 campaign exists three times over under three
titles and three years. The `howlongtobeatpy` package is dead and must not be
reintroduced; gwlib speaks the live protocol (CLU-130).

Every row on this list carries a real `w`. That is not decoration: the page
computes `WEIGHT = x.w >= 0 ? x.w : 1`, so one missing weight on a weighted
list silently books a game as an hour. There is no unweighted row here and no
mechanism below to produce one — a row whose figure fails the gate fails the
build instead.

The three editorial calls, made deliberately
--------------------------------------------
**Judgment ships, marked optional.** Wikipedia files it under "Spin-offs" and
its timeline leaves it unbolded, so the source does not call it mainline. It
is nevertheless the same genre played the same way, made by Epic with People
Can Fly, and it is a real finishable campaign — so excluding it would hide a
game a Gears club would obviously play. It ships in release order with
`opt: 1`: Baird's court-martial, a squad the numbered line never returns to,
and nothing after it depends on it.

**One row for the first game, not three.** *Ultimate Edition* (2015) and
*Reloaded* (2025) are remasters of the 2006 campaign, not new campaigns, so
they are folded into the 2006 row exactly as properties/halo.json folds
*Anniversary* into *Combat Evolved*. This is asserted rather than asserted-by
-vibes: the generator checks HowLongToBeat times both remasters within three
hours of the original, which is what "same campaign, better lighting" looks
like in the data. Their existence is stated in a note, because Ultimate
Edition is the version that restores the five chapters that were PC-only in
2006.

**Tactics ships optional; Pop! is excluded.** *Gears Tactics* is turn-based
tactics rather than a shooter — a different genre wearing the same war, which
is the identical call halo.json makes for Halo Wars, and it lands in the
Coalition-era section for the same reason Halo Wars 2 sits in the 343 section
despite Creative Assembly building it. It is also, at roughly 25 hours, the
longest campaign here, which is precisely why it must not be silently mixed
into the mainline total. *Gears Pop!* is excluded outright: a Funko-branded
mobile real-time strategy game with no campaign, whose servers Microsoft shut
off on 26 April 2021. There is no version of it left to play, which is the
same rule fps-canon uses to cut live-service shooters.

**The two DLC campaigns ship, marked optional.** *RAAM's Shadow* (2011) and
*Hivebusters* (2020) are separate single-player campaigns with their own
squads, sold apart from the games they attach to, and HowLongToBeat times
both. They are optional because each needs its parent game.

**E-Day is excluded because it is not out.** Wikipedia gives 6 October 2026.
HowLongToBeat has a record and no figure, and this file asserts that stays
true — the day the site starts timing it, this build fails and someone adds
the row, rather than the list quietly staying a game short.
