"""Generate properties/samurai-jack.json — all five seasons, every episode.

    PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python tools/make_samurai-jack.py

Genndy Tartakovsky's series in the source's own episode order: 62 rows, four
seasons of thirteen on Cartoon Network between 2001 and 2004, then ten more
in 2017 on Adult Swim.

THE 2017 SEASON IS SEASON FIVE, AND THE SOURCE SAYS SO IN FIVE PLACES. This
was the one real question — a different network, thirteen years later, a
different rating — and Wikipedia answers it the same way every time it is
asked. The series article's infobox counts `num_seasons = 5` and
`num_episodes = 62`. The episode list article's {{Series overview}} files it
as season 5, giving it the only `network` override in the template. The
season article opens "The fifth and final season of ''Samurai Jack'', an
American animated series, premiered on Adult Swim's Toonami programming
block on March 11, 2017", and its infobox carries `season_number = 5` with
`prev_season` pointing at season 4. The overall episode numbering runs
straight on, 52 to 53. The word "revival" is the source's too — the series
article says the show "was revived thirteen years later with a darker, more
mature fifth season that provided a conclusion to the series" — but it is a
revival OF this series, filed as its fifth season, not a separate work. So
it is section five here, and every one of those five statements is asserted
before this builds.

WHAT DID CHANGE IS THE NETWORK, AND EVERY SECTION SUBTITLE NAMES ITS OWN.
The {{Series overview}} declares a network twice and only twice — Cartoon
Network at season 1, Adult Swim at season 5 — and the template carries the
first forward until the second replaces it. That carry-forward is read here
rather than assumed, and the two declarations are asserted to be exactly
those two seasons, because the network change is the fact the subtitles are
for. Adult Swim's Toonami block is named alongside it, from the same
sentence the season article opens with.

THE OPENING THREE ARE THREE EPISODES. The source files them in one
{{Episode list}} block with `NumParts=3`, and that block numbers them
individually — 1, 2, and 3 overall, 1, 2 and 3 in season — with the three
part titles written into the summary as "Part I: The Beginning", "Part II:
The Samurai Called Jack" and "Part III: The First Fight". The block's own
Title field, "Samurai Jack: The Premiere Movie", is the name of the VHS and
DVD compilation the same article describes two paragraphs earlier, not the
name of an episode. So the rows follow the numbering and carry the part
titles; the compilation is named in the notes and gets no row of its own.
The same call is made for the two other multi-part blocks, "The Birth of
Evil" (37–38) and "The Scotsman Saves Jack" (45–46), whose parts the source
numbers separately but does not title separately, so those rows read
"Part I" and "Part II". Thirteen a season, 52 across four, is what the
source's own overview, its own prose and the series infobox all say, and all
three are checked.

THE ROMAN NUMERALS ARE THE SHOW'S OWN EPISODE NUMBERS. The list article
states the rule: "All episodes are identified in the credits by Roman
numerals, which correspond to the total number of episodes released until
the fifth season, which adds 40 to the number of the season 4 finale, LII
(52), to start the numeration of its episodes at XCII (92)". That is why the
2017 season's episodes are titled XCII to CI and have no descriptive titles
at all — the same sentence says only the first four seasons have "an
alternate, more descriptive title". Rather than trust the rule, this
generator applies it and then checks it: season 5's ten titles are read back
as numbers and asserted to be the ten the rule produces — 92 to 101, counting
on from the fourth-season finale plus forty rather than from 53 — and eight
numeral-and-title pairs the series article spells out in its own citations
("XXXII – Jack and the Traveling Creatures", "XXII – Jack vs. the Five
Hunters", and six more) are asserted to match what this derives.

BROADCAST ORDER IS NOT THE SOURCE'S ORDER. Several episodes went out
ahead of or behind their number — season 4 began while season 3 was still
airing. The list follows the source's numbering, which is the numbering the
credits use; that at least one airdate runs backwards against it is
asserted, because the note says so.

WEIGHTS: NONE, AFTER A HUNT THROUGH SIX SOURCES. Wikipedia and Wikidata
between them document a running time for three of the 62 episodes.
Checked, in order: (1) the {{Episode list}} blocks' own RunTime field —
absent from all 58 blocks on both articles; (2) the season 5 article's
{{Infobox television season}} — no runtime field; (3) per-episode Wikipedia
articles — there are none, every episode title either redirects to the
episode list or lands on something unrelated ("XCII" on 92 (number),
"C" on the letter); (4) Wikidata items for those titles — nothing to
resolve, for the same reason; (5) Wikidata's own inventory of the series,
`part of the series (P179) = Q694101` — 62 items, of which 9 are seasons and
53 are episodes, so nine of the 2017 season's ten have no item at all; (6)
P2047 duration on those 53 — present on three, episodes XXXI, XXXIX and
XLIX, at 23, 23 and 22 minutes. The series article's infobox does carry
`runtime = 22 minutes`, but that is one nominal figure for a 62-episode
run, and the only three real per-episode durations the sources hold are not
all 22 — so spreading it across every row would be a guessed number dressed
as a measured one. It is all rows or none (CLU-131), and a row with no `w`
on a weighted list silently counts as a full hour, so it is none; main()
asserts none.

Everything is machine-read from the cached Wikipedia wikitext of "List of
Samurai Jack episodes", "Samurai Jack season 5" and "Samurai Jack". Nothing
