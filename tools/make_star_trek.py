"""Generate properties/star-trek.json — all eleven series and all thirteen films.

    PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python tools/make_star_trek.py

ONE list, not a hub. The alternative was eleven per-series lists behind an
index page, and it was rejected: a club that sets out to watch Star Trek is
watching one thing, the strip is built to hold it (Criterion carries 1,418
rows), and splitting it would put the thirteen films either in a twelfth list
of their own or in none.

Sections are one per SEASON, running series by series in production order,
each titled with the series it belongs to. A section per series would have
meant 176-row and 172-row accordions with no season markers anywhere, and the
season is the unit people navigate a 60-year television franchise by; Doctor
Who ships the same shape, 355 rows across 46 season sections.

Series follow the date their first episode aired, which is why Lower Decks
and Prodigy sit ahead of Strange New Worlds. Each block of films follows the
series whose cast it continues, at the point those films begin: the six
original-cast films after The Animated Series, the four Next Generation films
immediately after that show's finale, and the three Kelvin films in the gap
after Enterprise when nothing was being made for television. The section
headings say plainly where a block overlaps a series that was already on the
air, rather than implying the run is a single line.

Nothing is weighted. See the "Nothing is weighted" note below and the
WEIGHTING assert in main(): the films have real runtimes, the episodes have
none that can be read, and a weighted list where some rows have no weight
counts those rows as one hour each.

Data: scratch/startrek/collect.py -> tools/data/star-trek-episodes.json, which
enumerates every {{Episode list}} row in Wikipedia's per-series episode tables
and is asserted here against each article's own {{Series overview}} counts.
