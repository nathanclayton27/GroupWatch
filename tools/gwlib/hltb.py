"""HowLongToBeat story hours, behind the verify-by-name gate.

The gate is the house rule that once kept a text adventure called Lost Pig
out of Metal Gear: a result only counts when its name normalizes to what
was asked for, and (when a year is given) its release year sits inside the
window. Games that fail ship unweighted with a note — never a guessed
number.

Why this module talks to the site itself
----------------------------------------
The `howlongtobeatpy` package is DEAD and must not be used. Its bundled
endpoint extractor points at /api/search, which 404s against the current
site, and it swallows the failure: every query returns None. It does not
raise. A generator built on it silently unweights an entire catalogue and
nobody notices — which is exactly what happened, twice, on the same night.
There is no fallback path to it here on purpose; `search()` below speaks the
protocol the site actually serves, and raises when it cannot.

The protocol, reconciled from two independent working implementations:

  * GET  /api/search/site/init  hands out a per-session {token, hpKey, hpVal}.
  * POST /api/search/site       wants the token in the headers AND the
    rotating hpKey/hpVal pair spliced into the payload body. It 404s without
    the payload copy — found by scratch/bondgames/collect.py.
  * Search terms are matched one at a time, so they must be split on
    PUNCTUATION, not whitespace: "Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X" split on
    spaces asks for a game containing the term "Man:" and finds nothing.
    Found by scratch/megaman/hltb_probe.py reading the site's own Next.js
    chunks; that one fix recovered seven Mega Man rows.

Failing loudly
--------------
A dead endpoint now raises `LookupBroken` instead of returning an empty
result set. "No game by that name" and "the lookup is broken" are different
answers and a generator must never confuse them — confusing them is how a
94-game catalogue quietly lost its weights.

Self-check (run it after any change here, and whenever a build's weights
look thin):

    python tools/gwlib/hltb.py --self-check

It asks for three known things — a plain title, a title with a colon in it,
and a title that must NOT verify — and exits non-zero if any answer stops
being plausible.
