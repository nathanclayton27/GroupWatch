Every Lego video game, from Wikipedia's "List of Lego video games", fetched
and parsed by scratch/lego/. The brief, verbatim: lump all the non tie-in
Lego games into a first section, then after Lego Star Wars go nuts.

So the first section is the whole unlicensed catalogue — Lego Island, Racers,
Rock Raiders, Creator, on through Worlds and 2K Drive — and from Lego Star
Wars: The Video Game (2005) the licensed tie-ins are grouped by franchise
family rather than by era, because the data leans that way hard: Star Wars,
the supers, and Harry Potter each have a run long enough to be its own story,
and eras would shuffle those three decks together for no gain.

Choices, stated rather than buried:
- Lego Fortnite is excluded. It is a mode inside Epic's Fortnite, not a
  standalone Lego game — the same line the Star Wars games list draws for
  crossovers into other studios' games.
- Mobile-only rows from the unlicensed table (30 of them, J2ME and app-store
  spinoffs) sit in a compact last section instead of burying Lego Island
  under Lego Duplo Zoo. A licensed mobile spinoff stays with its franchise,
  marked, because a franchise section is a timeline and holes in it lie.
  Mobile-only is mechanical: the article lists no PC, console or handheld
  release. (So Lego Legacy: Heroes Unboxed, which has a Windows port, stays
  in the first section.)
- The two Creator: Harry Potter expansions (2001, 2002) are licensed and
  predate Lego Star Wars; they open the Wizarding World section rather than
  polluting the unlicensed one.
- The Lego Batman Movie Game sits with the film tie-ins, not the supers —
  it adapts the film, alongside the other Lego-movie games.
- Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is announced for 2026 and stays,
  marked; the article lists nothing cancelled, so nothing else needed a
  shipped/never-shipped call.

No weights. Playtimes for a hundred-odd games are not available at a scale
worth trusting, and a made-up number would go straight into everyone's pace,
so every game counts as one.
