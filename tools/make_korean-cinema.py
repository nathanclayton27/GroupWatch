"The best of Korean cinema" is a verdict, and this catalogue does not ship
verdicts. So this list never decides that a Korean film is one of the best: it
takes the selection Korea's own national film archive made, and, for the years
that selection could not reach, counts how many of Korea's film juries have
since named a film. Both figures ride on every row, so a reader can argue with
either one.

The gate
--------
**A film is here if the Korean Film Archive's 2014 selection of 100 Korean
films named it, or — released after that selection closed — if at least two of
Korea's eight film juries have since named it.**

Clause one is the spine. KOFA is the country's sole national film archive, a
government body founded in 1974, and its "100 Korean Films" is the closest
thing Korean cinema has to a native canon: one considered survey of the whole
history rather than a prize for one year. The archive publishes it itself, at
eng.koreafilm.or.kr, with a director, a release year and — this is what makes
it usable here — a KMDb identifier per row, KMDb being the archive's own
database. Nothing on this list was matched by title.

Clause two exists because that selection was made in 2014 and its newest entry
is Pietà (2012). Parasite could not have been on it. Neither could Burning.
The films released since are admitted only where at least two of these eight
agree, each of which is a record of what a Korean institution chose rather
than an opinion this file formed:

    Blue Dragon · Grand Bell · Baeksang · Buil · Chunsa · the Korean Film
    Awards · the Korean Association of Film Critics — Best Film in each — and
    the committee that picks the country's Academy Award entry.

Why not a flat count across all nine
------------------------------------
It was tried first, because a single countable number per row is what
cult-classics ships and it is the better shape. The distribution killed it:
at "two of nine", THE HOUSEMAID falls out. The archive's own number one — the
film Wikipedia's article on Korean cinema names as one of the two best the
country has made — would have been cut for winning no year-prize in 1960.
So would 3-Iron, Chunhyang and sixty-eight other archive selections. A flat
count only works when the sources are the same kind of thing, as
cult-classics' twenty-three books are. One considered canon and seven annual
prizes are not, and averaging them lies about both.

Why two and not one, in clause two
----------------------------------
At one jury the modern section grows from 19 rows to 37 and takes in Revolver,
Smugglers, Harbin, Next Sohee and Possible Love — a film that has not been
released. Every one of those is a real prize honestly won; none of them is
what somebody means by the best of Korean cinema. Two is where a modern row
stops being one jury's pick of one year. It is not tuned for scale: three
would give 8 rows and would drop Burning, which is the check that says a gate
is wrong.

The sanity checks, and what the gate refuses
--------------------------------------------
All four obvious ones clear it without being special-cased, and the generator
asserts each with its reason so a future edit cannot quietly lose one:

  * **Oldboy** (2003) — the archive selected it, as "Old Boy". It also won the
    Korean Film Awards' Best Film and the critics' association's.
  * **Memories of Murder** (2003) — the archive ranked it eighth, the highest
    of any film made this century.
  * **Parasite** (2019) — six of the eight juries, more than any other film
    here.
  * **Burning** (2018) — two: the Grand Bell's Best Film, and Korea's Academy
    Award entry that year.

What it refuses is worth naming, because it is the honest cost:

  * **The Handmaiden** (2016) and **Train to Busan** (2016) are on none of
    these lists at all. Korea's juries gave The Handmaiden its Best Director
    nominations and its Best Film prizes went elsewhere, and it was not the
    country's Academy entry — The Age of Shadows was. This is the clearest
    thing the gate throws out and it should be argued with.
  * **The Wailing** (2016), **House of Hummingbird** (2018) and **Hill of
    Freedom** (2014) each have exactly one jury and stop there.
  * Everything between 2013 and today that only one jury liked — eighteen
    films, listed by the generator when it runs.

Traps this file hit, and what it did about them
------------------------------------------------
  * **A KMDb id carries a collection letter and it is load-bearing.**
    Ninety-nine of the archive's hundred are `K/#####`; Repatriation is
    `A/03370`, a documentary. Wikidata files those under a different property
    and KMDb serves them from a different path, so dropping the letter fetched
    a 1979 melodrama and would have shipped its Wikidata id on a 2003
    documentary's row.
  * **Reading a table cell by offset crosses row boundaries.** The archive's
    page gives some rows an extra YouTube button; searching forward from the
    title for a KMDb link picked up the NEXT row's id. The row is the unit
    now, and nothing is read across it.
  * **A title search finds the wrong film, reliably.** Looking up the fourteen
    archive rows Wikidata has no KMDb id for by name returned a 1960 film for
    The Wedding Day (1956) and a 1928 one for Rainy Days (1979). Those rows
    ship with no `q` rather than a guessed one.
  * **The archive's earlier selection is not readable.** KOFA published a
    100 Korean Films in 1996 too and still links it, but all five tabs of
    that page serve the same first twenty rows, so eighty of its hundred
    cannot be read at all. It would have been a second, older archive voice
    to count with; it is left out rather than shipped as a fifth of itself.
  * **Blue Dragon and Baeksang list nominees beside winners.** Oldboy is a
    2003 Blue Dragon Best Film NOMINEE — Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and
    Spring won — so only the row carrying {{double dagger}} counts, and the
    generator asserts the totals that fact produces.

Wikidata ids
------------
104 of the 119 rows carry `q`, which build.py groups on ahead of title and
year. Every one was resolved from an identifier the source itself printed —
the archive's KMDb number for its own selections, the award article's own
wikilink for the juries' — and then checked against the item's P31 and P577:
an item that is not a film, or whose publication dates miss the row's year by
more than a year, loses its id rather than risk ticking a film nobody watched.

Weights
-------
Every row is weighted and no figure was invented. 83 come from the film's own
English Wikipedia infobox; the other 36 have no English article at all and
take the running time from the archive's own database, the 상영시간 field of
the film's KMDb record, matched to the release the archive dated. Wikidata's
P2047 is carried only as a cross-check and disagrees with the infobox on six
rows, which is why it is not the source.
