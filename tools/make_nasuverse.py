    python3 tools/make_nasuverse.py

Type-Moon's shared universe — Fate, Tsukihime, Melty Blood, Kara no Kyoukai,
Witch on the Holy Night — organised by media type, release order inside each.

Dates come from Wikipedia's Type-Moon release list and the individual work
articles' infoboxes, read rather than typed. Where only a year could be
confirmed the entry shows the year and nothing finer; nothing here is a guess.

LENGTHS come from tools/data/nasuverse.json, which scratch/nasuverse/
collect.py builds out of three sources and no guesses: HowLongToBeat
main-story figures behind gwlib.hltb's verify-by-name gate for the games and
visual novels, the work's own Wikipedia infobox runtime for the films and
anime, and nothing at all for the novels and manga, because pages are not
hours. This file never fetches — it reads that data file and asserts every
row is accounted for, so running it twice produces identical output.

A row with no length keeps its reason. The data file carries the full one
and the generator refuses to emit a row without it; the row's own note gets
the short version, so a reader can see why a bar has no number on it. The
reasons are real and various: an announced visual novel with no release
date, an anime whose article gives a RANGE of episode lengths rather than a
figure, a Kara no Kyoukai film that is already inside the seven-film row
above it, remasters HowLongToBeat times once under the original.

Tier 2 marks a work its own remake supersedes — the 2000 Tsukihime, the 2004
Fate/stay night, the 2005 Fate/hollow ataraxia. They stay in the list because
this is a catalogue of what exists, but a finish date paces you through the
versions actually worth starting on. Nothing else is ranked: the "where to
start" advice lives in the notes rather than being invented per row.
