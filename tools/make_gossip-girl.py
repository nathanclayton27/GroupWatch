"""Generate properties/gossip-girl.json — the original CW series, 2007-2012.

    python3 tools/make_gossip-girl.py

One row per episode, 121 rows covering all 121 episodes. No entry in the six
season tables spans two episode numbers, so rows and episodes are the same
number here — unlike The Golden Girls, where they are not.

Deliberately excluded: the 2021 HBO Max series of the same name (a separate
show with its own episode list), the two clip specials the list page files
under "Specials" — Gossip Girl: Revealed and Gossip Girl: XOXO — and the six
Chasing Dorota webisodes. None of the three sit inside the run's 121
broadcast episodes.

Episode titles and airdates are machine-read from the six "Gossip Girl
season N" articles by scratch/agent-tv3/extract_tv3.py, which asserts every
season's numbering contiguous and equal to the list page's own Series
overview counts (121 in the lede); the committed result is
tools/data/gossip-girl-episodes.json. This script re-asserts the totals
before it writes anything.

Nothing is weighted: an episode counts one, which keeps 121 marks even.
