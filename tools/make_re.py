Mainline Resident Evil in release order — the numbered games, Code:
Veronica, the remakes (marked), and the two Chronicles recaps as the only
spin-offs kept.

Hours are HowLongToBeat main-story figures — story only — read from
tools/data/residentevil.json, which was collected by scratch/re/fetch_hltb.py
and verified there by name AND release year; the original/remake name
collisions (RE 1996/2002, RE2 1998/2019, RE3 1999/2020, RE4 2005/2023) make
the year part of the identity, and the generator re-checks both.

Tiers:
  1  the mainline story spine — the numbered games, 0 through Requiem
  2  the canon between the numbers — Code: Veronica and the Revelations pair
  3  the remakes (marked) and the two kept spin-offs

Requiem (February 2026) is the ninth mainline game and is included with
real HLTB data.  Resident Evil Veronica, the Code: Veronica remake, is due
2027 and gets a note rather than a row.
