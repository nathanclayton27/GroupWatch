"""Generate properties/final-fantasy.json.

    python3 tools/make_ff.py

The sixteen numbered Final Fantasy games in release order, plus the branches
off them: the direct sequels (X-2, XIII-2, Lightning Returns) and the VII
remake line. Every numbered game stands alone — that is the property's first
note, because it is the franchise's whole deal.

Hours are HowLongToBeat main-story figures, read from
tools/data/finalfantasy.json, which scratch/ff/fetch_hltb.py collected one
search at a time and verified by name and year (the list itself was checked
against Wikipedia's series page first). This generator re-verifies every
record's name before using it.

Tiers:
  1  the sixteen numbered games — the spine a finish date paces
  2  the branches: direct sequels and the VII remake line

XIV is one row for the whole MMO. HLTB's figure is A Realm Reborn's base
story, and the note says what that leaves out — a decade of expansions.
