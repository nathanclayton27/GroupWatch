"""Generate properties/the-big-o.json — all 26 episodes, both seasons.

    python3 tools/make_the-big-o.py

Sunrise's film-noir mecha series: thirteen episodes on Wowow in 1999–2000,
thirteen more on Sun Television in 2003. 26 rows, one per episode, in the
broadcast order and the numbering the source itself uses.

THE SLUG IS `the-big-o`, NOT `big-o`. The house is split on leading articles —
x-files, twilight-zone and sandman drop theirs; the-office, the-wire,
the-simpsons and the-sopranos keep theirs — and the split is not arbitrary.
The ones that drop it are already unique without it. The ones that keep it
would otherwise be a generic phrase standing for something else, which is
exactly this title's problem: `?p=big-o` reads as the complexity notation
before it reads as an anime. The source keeps the article too — the article's
own DISPLAYTITLE and bold lead are both ''The Big O''.

THE TWO SEASONS WERE MADE UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THAT IS A FACT
ABOUT THE PRODUCTION, so it rides in the section subs the way vinland-saga's
two studios do. Both articles say it, and main() asserts both sentences
before this builds:

  * the series article's lead: "Originally planned as a 26-episode series,
    low viewership in Japan reduced production to the first 13. Positive
    international reception resulted in a second season consisting of the
    remaining 13 episodes, co-produced by Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and
    Bandai Visual."; and
  * the episode-list article: "Originally a 26-episode series, it was reduced
    to 13 episodes due to low ratings in Japan. However, positive
    international reception resulted in a second season co-produced by
    Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and Bandai Visual."

So season 1's sub names Sunrise alone and season 2's names Sunrise with
Cartoon Network and Bandai Visual. The studio never changed; the money did.

IT ENDS WHERE IT ENDS, AND THE SOURCE DOCUMENTS WHY WITHOUT ANYONE HAVING TO
DESCRIBE THE ENDING. The production section: "Along with the 13 episodes of
season two, Cartoon Network had an option for 26 additional episodes to be
written by Konaka, but according to Jason DeMarco, executive producer for
season two, the middling ratings and DVD sales in the United States and Japan
made any further episodes impossible to be produced." A continuation was
optioned and it was not made — that is a production fact and it is the whole
of what this list says about the end. What the last episode IS (a finale) is
allowed; what happens in it is not, and nothing here says.

NUMBERING IS THE SOURCE'S. The episode-list article numbers season 2 as
episodes 14 to 26 rather than restarting at 1, and there is no
EpisodeNumber2 anywhere in it, so there is no in-season numbering to prefer.
Rows therefore run 1 to 26 straight through, asserted contiguous.

WEIGHTS: NONE, AND THE HUNT IS THE FINDING. Four places a per-episode running
time could live were checked and all four came up empty; scratch/agent-bigo/
holds the probes, and main() re-asserts what it can from the cached wikitext:

  1. Each episode's own Wikipedia article. There are none. All 26 titles were
     probed bare, as "<title> (The Big O)" and as "<title> (The Big O
     episode)" — 78 candidates. Seven of the bare forms exist, because six of
     the titles are common nouns (Leviathan, Hydra, Stripes, Eyewitness,
     Electric City) and one is a Queen lyric; every one of them is a
     disambiguation page or an unrelated subject, none carries P31 =
     television series episode, and none carries P179 = The Big O. Not one
     Title field in the episode table is a wikilink either, which main()
     asserts.
  2. Per-episode Wikidata P2047. There are no per-episode Wikidata items at
     all: the series is Q974411, and a haswbstatement search for items
     declaring P179, P361 or P4908 pointing at it returns zero. The series
     item itself carries no P2047 and no P527 has-part statements, so there
     is nothing to read a runtime off.
  3. Season articles. There are none. "The Big O season 1" and "The Big O
     season 2" both redirect to the episode-list article and "The Big O II"
     redirects to the series article, so the list article's two section
     headings are the only season-level source that exists.
  4. The episode table's own RunTime fields, and the infoboxes. Not one of
     the 26 {{Episode list}} blocks carries a RunTime. The series uses
     {{Infobox animanga/Video}}, which carries no runtime parameter in either
     of its two instances, and the string "minutes" does not occur anywhere
     in the series article, the episode-list article or the music article.

All 26 rows or none, because a row with no `w` on a weighted list silently
counts as one hour (CLU-131) — 26 half-hours would read as 26 hours. It is
none, main() asserts none, and the notes name every source that was checked.

CROSS-LIST SYNC: THERE IS NONE, AND IT IS CONFIRMED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.
build.py's gate is `syncable = "film" in kind or "game" in kind`; this list's
kind is "anime", so no row ever reaches the pairing code. main() re-states
that gate literally so a future kind change trips it. Belt and braces, it
also asserts no row carries an explicit `y`, no `n` is a bare year, and no
note contains one — the note fallback in build.py reads a single year out of
a note when `n` is not a year, and an episode called "Leviathan" pairing with
a same-titled film is exactly the accident that would cause. Airdates are
therefore kept out of row notes entirely and live in the section intros.

ONE AIRDATE DISAGREES WITH ITSELF, AND THE EPISODE TABLE WINS. The series
article's second infobox closes season 2 on March 23, 2003. The episode table
dates the last episode March 27, 2003, and the episode-list article's prose
says the season "concluded with 'The Show Must Go On' on March 27, 2003".
Two sources to one, and the table is internally consistent — season 2 ran
weekly from Thursday January 2, and thirteen weekly slots land on March 27.
main() asserts the table and the prose agree, and asserts the infobox is
still carrying its known discrepancy so that a third value would fail the
build rather than pass unnoticed.

EXCLUSIONS. Everything else in the franchise is another medium: the six-volume
manga (1999–2001) and the two-volume Lost Memory (2002–2003), the Paradigm
Noise novel, the "Walking Together On The Yellow Brick Road" drama CD, and
the Super Robot Wars appearances. The 2001 Toonami broadcast, the uncut Adult
Swim reruns and the 2007 Animax reruns are the same 26 episodes, not more of
them. There is no film and no OVA; main() asserts the series article still
files exactly two {{Infobox animanga/Video}} blocks, so a third one appearing
fails the build.

Everything is machine-read from the cached Wikipedia wikitext in
scratch/agent-bigo/. Nothing is typed in from memory. Before anything is
written: each season's parsed row count is asserted against that season's own
{{Infobox animanga/Video}} episodes field AND against the two prose sentences
that give the split; the overall numbering is asserted contiguous 1..26;
airdates are asserted non-decreasing and matched against each infobox's first
and last dates; each section's year span is asserted against the year span in
the list article's own section heading; and the accent pair is asserted
unused by every other property on disk.
