Everything Nathan Fielder created, in the order it aired: four seasons and a
special of *Nathan for You*, two seasons of *The Rehearsal*, one season of
*The Curse*. Fifty-four episodes, three sections, nothing else.

Every title, number, airdate and count below is machine-read from Wikipedia
wikitext cached in scratch/nathan-fielder/ — the "Nathan Fielder" article for
the roster, "List of Nathan for You episodes" plus "Nathan for You" for the
cable show, "The Rehearsal (TV series)" and "The Curse (American TV series)"
for the other two. Nothing is typed in from memory, and every number this file
prints is asserted against the source that produced it before anything is
written.

THE RULE FOR WHAT IS ON THE LIST: HE CREATED IT
------------------------------------------------
Matt Johnson's list settled on Director = Yes, because his filmography carries
a Director column with {{Yes}} in it. Fielder's does not: his filmography is
two tables with a free-text Notes column, and he is variously creator, writer,
director, executive producer, consulting producer and actor, frequently four
of those on the same row. So a credit has to be chosen rather than read off a
column, and this list chooses **creator**.

That is the credit that makes these his. A bare directing filter would sweep in
two episodes of Sacha Baron Cohen's *Who Is America?* and five short films with
no article, no runtime and no way to watch them; a producing filter would sweep
in *How To with John Wilson*, which is John Wilson's show. Creator admits
exactly three works and they are exactly the three the show-off sentence about
Fielder always names:

  * ''Nathan for You'' — "Creator, writer, director, and executive producer",
    with Michael Koman;
  * ''The Rehearsal''  — "Creator, executive producer, writer, director";
  * ''The Curse''      — "Main role; also co-creator, writer and director",
    with Benny Safdie.

The test is a bare \\bcreator\\b against the Role and Notes cells of both
filmography tables, case-insensitive so it catches "Creator" and "co-creator"
alike. Both cells, not just Notes: the Role column normally holds a character
name, but where he does not appear in a work it holds his crew credit instead —
the short film *Kelly 5-9* keeps its entire directing credit there and has
nothing in Notes but "Short film". Reading one column is how a credit filter
goes silently short by a row, and this generator did exactly that for one
draft before the short-film count came out at four.

main() asserts the roster the test produces is those three and no others. It also
pins the three near-misses by name — *How To with John Wilson* (executive
producer only), *Who Is America?* (consulting producer and co-director) and
*Jon Benjamin Has a Van* (creative consultant, the one row whose Notes cell
contains the letters "creat" without a creator credit) — so that a Wikipedia
editor rewording any of them into a creator credit breaks the build rather
than silently changing what this list means.

THE LEAD IS CROSS-CHECKED AGAINST THE FILMOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------
A rowspan in a wikitable silently loses rows, and a recent work reaches an
article's lead paragraph before its filmography table catches up — which is
exactly how the Matt Johnson list nearly shipped one film short. So main()
pulls every italicised wikilink out of the lead and asserts each one is either
a shipped section or a page this file excludes on purpose, by name, with a
reason. It also asserts the reverse: every shipped show is named in the lead.
A fourth Fielder show appearing in the lead fails the build.

The table reader carries rowspans down anyway, though neither of these two
tables uses one today. It costs four lines and it is the bug that has bitten
this repo three times.

WEIGHTS: NONE, AND THE CHECK IS IN THE CODE
--------------------------------------------
All-or-nothing, and it is nothing. The page resolves
`WEIGHT = x.w >= 0 ? x.w : 1`, so one unweighted row on an otherwise weighted
list silently books itself as a full hour; since the home page fills its bars
by hours on fully weighted lists, that distortion is visible to readers.

Not one of the three articles publishes a per-episode runtime. main() asserts
all three legs of that:

  * *The Rehearsal* infobox: "27–58 minutes" — a range for the series;
  * *The Curse* infobox: "38–69 minutes" — a range for the series;
  * *Nathan for You* infobox: a flat "21 minutes", which looks usable and is
    not. Its own episode list calls the finale, "Finding Frances", a
    "90-minute series finale" in the same article. A series-level figure
    applied to every episode would be an invention with a citation stapled to
    it, and it would be wrong by 69 minutes on that row alone.
  * and no {{Episode list}} block on any of the three pages carries a RunTime
    field at all.

Every one of those is an assertion, not a comment. If The Rehearsal's infobox
ever states a single figure, or the episode blocks grow RunTime fields, or the
Nathan for You finale stops being described as 90 minutes, this build fails and
whoever is standing there weights the list instead of the omission quietly
outliving its reason. These shows have wildly uneven episodes — 27 to 69
minutes across the two prestige runs — so an invented uniform figure would be
worse here than on most lists.

SEASONS ARE ASSERTED THREE WAYS, AND A NEW ONE BREAKS THE BUILD
----------------------------------------------------------------
None of the three shows has a per-season Wikipedia article — no {{Main}} link
to one exists on any of them — so "each season's own infobox" resolves to the
strongest per-season sources that do exist, and every season is checked against
all of them:

  1. the {{Series overview}} `episodesN` count, and its `startN`/`endN` dates
     against the first and last episode this file actually parsed for that
     season;
  2. the series {{Infobox television}} `num_seasons` and `num_episodes`;
  3. the article's own `=== Season N (year) ===` headings, which is how the
     episodes are grouped in the first place — the Nathan for You special sits
     between the third and fourth seasons and is filed under its own heading,
     which is why it lands between S3E8 and S4E1 here rather than at the end.

Numbering is asserted contiguous overall and within each season, airdates are
asserted non-decreasing, and every episode is asserted to have aired on or
before the day this runs. As of this writing the counts are 4+special / 2 / 1
seasons and 32 / 12 / 10 episodes; a fifth Nathan for You, a third Rehearsal or
a second Curse changes those numbers and fails this build, which is the point.

SPOILERS
--------
*The Curse* and *The Rehearsal* both turn on things a row note would ruin, so
neither section carries a single row note and the intros describe premises
only. The two notes on the whole list are on Nathan for You's special (what it
is) and its finale (that it is feature-length), and neither gives anything away.

THE BLURB CARRIES NO EPISODE COUNT (CLU-190), and no hours, because this list
does not track them.
