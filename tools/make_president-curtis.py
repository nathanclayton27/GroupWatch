"""Generate properties/president-curtis.json — President Curtis (2026).

    python3 tools/make_president-curtis.py

The Rick and Morty spin-off: Keith David's President Andre Curtis and his
staff handling the crises Rick leaves alone. Ten episodes, weekly on Sundays
on Adult Swim from 26 July 2026, reaching HBO Max the day after broadcast.
Adult Swim renewed it for a second season two days before the premiere.

Season one is mid-air, which makes this the second property after lanterns to
carry a `schedule` — one dated window per episode, so the pace line answers
"am I caught up with the broadcast" rather than "will I finish by some
distant date". The window shape is lanterns' exactly: a window opens on an
episode's air date and runs six days, and `through` is that episode's number.

All ten episodes are listed even though only some have aired. An announced
row is what an airing show looks like and the schedule needs the whole
season; the aired/upcoming wording in the row notes is frozen by AS_OF below
rather than read from the clock, so two runs of this file always agree.

Titles and air dates are machine-read from the {{Episode list}} rows of the
Wikipedia article "President Curtis (TV series)" by
scratch/agent-curtis/episodes.py, which asserts the numbering is 1..N
contiguous and that N matches the season length the article states in prose;
the committed result is tools/data/president-curtis-episodes.json.

Nothing is weighted. The episode table declares no runtime column, no
episode has its own article or Wikidata item, and the series' Wikidata item
carries no P2047 — the infobox's blanket "24 minutes" is a series-level
figure, not per-episode data, and ten identical invented weights would be a
guess dressed as a measurement. Every episode counts one, as in
make_xfiles.py.
