"""Generate properties/made-in-abyss.json — both seasons and the one film
that is not a re-cut of them.

    python3 tools/make_made-in-abyss.py

Kinema Citrus' adaptation of Akihito Tsukushi's manga, in the order the
source puts it: season 1, the sequel film, season 2. 26 rows.

THREE FILMS EXIST AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS A ROW. THIS IS THE WHOLE JOB.
Wikipedia's episode-list article files all three under one heading,
"Theatrical film trilogy (2019–20)", sitting between season 1 and season 2 —
which is why a reader coming to this cold sees three films and assumes three
sittings. Two of them are not. The list article's own prose, asserted in
main() rather than believed:

    Two [[compilation film]]s, titled ... "Journey's Dawn" (encompassing
    episodes 1–8 with new scenes for introduction) and ... "Wandering
    Twilight" (encompassing episodes 9–13), were released on January 4,
    2019, and January 18, 2019, respectively.

Episodes 1–8 and 9–13 is the whole of season 1, and main() asserts exactly
that: the two ranges are contiguous, start at 1, and end at the season's last
episode. Carrying them as rows would count all thirteen episodes a second
time — in the row count, and in the hours if this list were weighted.

The third film is a different kind of thing, and three separate statements in
the cached source say so, all three asserted:

  * the franchise article's lead: "A sequel film, subtitled ''Dawn of the
    Deep Soul'', premiered in Japan in January 2020";
  * the list article: "Following the release of the first compilation films,
    the sequel was revealed to be a film titled ... Made in Abyss the Movie:
    Dawn of the Deep Soul", premiering January 17, 2020; and
  * the footnote on season 2's first episode, which places that season
    "Directly after the events of the film ... Dawn of the Deep Soul".

So it is a sequel, it cannot be skipped, and it goes between the seasons —
which is where the source's own running order puts it, as the last of the
three films in a section sitting between the two season sections. The two
compilations are named in the notes as an alternative way to watch season
one, which is all they are.

WEIGHTS: NONE, AND IT IS ALL-OR-NOTHING. Wikipedia documents no running time
for this series — no `runtime` on either television infobox, and no `Runtime`
field on any of the 25 episode blocks, both asserted in main(). The film
infobox does give 105 minutes, and that is precisely the trap: weighting the
film while 25 episodes have no verifiable number would leave every episode
row resolving `WEIGHT = x.w >= 0 ? x.w : 1` to a full hour, so 25 half-hour
episodes would read as 25 hours (CLU-131). The only per-episode lengths the
source gives are the two "One hour season finale special" footnotes, one on
each season's last episode — both read here, because they are worth telling a
reader, and two durations out of 25 cannot weight a list. So no row carries a
`w`, the film included, and its runtime rides in the row note as text.

Everything is machine-read from the cached Wikipedia wikitext in
scratch/agent-abyss/made-in-abyss/ — the episode-list article and the
franchise article. Before anything is written: each season's parsed row count
is asserted against the list article's {{Series overview}}; each season's
in-season numbering is asserted to run 1..N and the overall numbering to run
1..25 unbroken; air dates are asserted non-decreasing and matched against the
overview's start and end dates; the film table is asserted to hold exactly
the three films this generator knows, in that order, with those dates; the
franchise article is asserted to carry exactly four anime video infoboxes, so
a newly released installment breaks the build instead of going missing; and
the accent pair is asserted unused by every other property on disk.
