"""Generate properties/sailor-moon.json — the 1990s run, in broadcast order.

    python3 tools/make_sailor-moon.py

Two hundred episodes across five seasons, with the three films, the two
theatrical shorts and the three television specials each sitting on the date
it went out. 208 rows, one section per season, nothing weighted.

SAILOR MOON CRYSTAL IS NOT HERE, AND THAT IS THE DECISION THIS LIST HAD TO
MAKE. Crystal (2014– ) is a second, independent adaptation of the same Naoko
Takeuchi manga — the Fullmetal Alchemist situation exactly, where
properties/fullmetal-alchemist.json and properties/fma-brotherhood.json are
two lists rather than one. The source settles it in its own words, in two
places, both asserted in main() before anything is written:

  * the Crystal article's lead — "Crystal serves as a reboot by faithfully
    adapting the original manga by omitting much of the original materials
    from the first anime series"; and
  * the 1992 series article's lead — "A new animated adaptation, Sailor Moon
    Crystal, which is a reboot series that more closely follows the manga,
    began airing worldwide in July 2014".

A reboot that omits this series' material is not more of this series, and
Wikipedia keeps the two apart structurally as well as in prose: this list's
source article opens with a hatnote sending "the 2014 web series episode
list" to a separate List of Sailor Moon Crystal episodes, which main() also
asserts. Sections on this page would have been wrong twice over — Crystal
re-tells the same arcs, so the same story would appear on one list twice, and
its 39 episodes are numbered Act 1 upward in a scheme of their own.

So Crystal, and its two-part films Sailor Moon Eternal (2021) and Sailor Moon
Cosmos (2023), belong on a list of their own, which is a separate card and is
NOT built here. The notes on this page name it and say why, and are written
so that adding the pointer — the "also on clubd" sentence
properties/fullmetal-alchemist.json carries towards Brotherhood — is one
edit to one note when that list exists.

THE FILMS AND SPECIALS ARE PLACED, NOT PARKED. Every one of the eight
non-episode entries is dated by the source into the middle of a season's own
run, so this list uses the babylon-5 method: a film that opened while a
season was on the air sits inside that season's rows at the point it opened,
not in a section of its own. In the source's OVERALL numbering: the R film
opened between episodes 76 and 77, the S film between 116 and 117, the SuperS
film on the same day episode 158 aired, and the three SuperS specials went out
on a single Sunday between episodes 131 and 132 — which is what the source
means when it says they aired "in lieu of a regular episode near the beginning
of the SuperS season". Nothing here is placed by hand: each entry is filed by
comparing its date against the season boundaries and then against the
episodes, and main() asserts that every one landed exactly once. The note on
the page describes the same four slots in the IN-SEASON numbers the rows
actually display, and placement_of() generates that sentence out of the
sequence it built, so the note cannot drift from where the rows ended up.

ROW NUMBERS ARE THE JAPANESE NUMBERS, AND THE ENGLISH DIFFERENCE IS A NOTE.
The 1990s English dub cut and merged episodes, and the source records it
precisely: the season 1 and R episode tables carry a column the table header
itself labels DiC, holding the dub's number for each episode, an em dash
where the dub dropped one, and 40a/40b for the two that became a single dub
episode. Read straight, that column says six episodes were never dubbed and
two became one — seven numbers lost out of the first 89 — and three separate
sentences in the source say the same thing independently: "DIC had mandated
cuts to content and length, which reduced the first 89 episodes by seven",
season one's "the season's 46 episodes were cut down to 40", and R's
"omitting only one of the season's 43 episodes". All three are asserted
against the column in scratch/agent-sailor/build_data.py. What this list will
NOT do is reconstruct a dub running order, because the source does not give
one: it gives numbers, and only for the first two seasons. So the rows are
numbered the Japanese way from end to end, and the eight affected rows carry
a note saying what the dub did to them.

NOTHING IS WEIGHTED, AND THE HUNT WAS EXHAUSTIVE. Five sources were checked
for a per-episode running time and four of them hold nothing at all:

  * the episode tables' own RunTime fields — not one of the 200 episode
    blocks, or the 3 special blocks, carries one;
  * the five season articles' infoboxes — every runtime field empty;
  * the series article's infobox — runtime empty;
  * an article per episode — there is none. Not one of the 200 Title cells is
    even a wikilink, and fetching all 200 titles as article names finds 143
    that do not exist, 36 redirects (24 of them back into the episode list),
    17 unrelated articles, and 4 titles that both exist and mention Sailor
    Moon — three disambiguation pages and a 1947 Joe McDoakes short whose
    article carries a hatnote pointing back at the episode list;
  * Wikidata — 135 items declare membership of this series, and exactly TEN
    of them carry a P2047. Ten runtimes out of two hundred episodes.

The films do publish runtimes (61, 61 and 62 minutes), and that is the trap
rather than the answer: an unweighted row resolves to one hour, so weighting
three films beside 200 unweighted episodes would have the strip claim each
half-hour episode takes sixty minutes. It is all rows or none, it is none,
main() asserts none, and the film runtimes ride in the row notes as text.

Everything is machine-read. scratch/agent-sailor/fetch.py primes the wikitext
cache 40 titles a request; scratch/agent-sailor/census.py runs the runtime
hunt above; scratch/agent-sailor/build_data.py parses the five season
articles, the list article, the series article and the three film articles
and writes the committed tools/data/sailor-moon.json, asserting as it goes
that each season's parsed count matches both the list article's series
overview and the season article's own infobox, that the in-season numbering
runs 1..N, that the overall numbering is contiguous 1..200, that airdates are
in broadcast order and match the infobox's first and last, and that the
series infobox still reads "200 + 3 TV specials".
