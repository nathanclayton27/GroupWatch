The three founding masked-killer franchises in one list: Halloween, Friday
the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, plus the one film that belongs to two
of them. Every row is a released theatrical feature taken from its
franchise's own Films table on Wikipedia, weighted by the runtime that film's
own article infobox states.

WHY RELEASE ORDER, AND WHY THIS LIST HAS TO SAY SO
--------------------------------------------------
These franchises do not share one timeline, and Halloween does not even share
one with itself. Wikipedia's Halloween article carries a story-chronology box
listing FIVE mutually exclusive continuities; this generator reads that box
rather than trusting anyone's memory of it, and asserts the three facts the
list's intro claims:

  * the 1978 film opens three of the five;
  * Halloween 4 (1988) and Halloween H20 (1998) are each written as the
    sequel to Halloween II (1981), in different continuities;
  * Halloween II (1981) and Halloween (2018) are each written as the sequel
    to Halloween (1978).

So no chronological order exists that can hold all thirteen films, and any
list that silently picked one would be picking a side. This one picks U.S.
release order — the single order nobody disputes, and the order audiences
actually met the films in, each sequel having been made in answer to the one
before. The continuities are explained in the section intros and flagged
factually on the rows that start or end one; they are never imposed as
sequence. Sections are ordered the same way, by the year each franchise
began: Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), Elm Street (1984).

WHICH FRANCHISES, AND WHY NOT SCREAM OR CHILD'S PLAY
----------------------------------------------------
The brief was "long franchise with a tangled continuity", and both candidates
were collected so the call could rest on data rather than impression:

  * Scream — seven released films across thirty years, so long enough, but
    its article carries no chronology box and its Films table carries no
    continuity blocks, because there is nothing to divide: one unbroken
    timeline, no remake, no reboot. The problem this list exists to rule on
    never arises, and a section whose intro said "watch them in order" would
    be dead weight next to Halloween's five timelines.
  * Child's Play — eight released films, and its own Films table splits them
    into exactly two labelled blocks, "Original series" and "Reboot", which
    never intersect. That is a clean fork, not a tangle; and the original
    line's story continues in the Chucky television series, which a films
    list cannot hold without misrepresenting where the story goes.

FREDDY VS. JASON
----------------
It appears in the Films table of BOTH the Nightmare and the Friday articles —
the eighth film of one and the eleventh of the other — and the generator
asserts the two tables agree on its title, date and runtime. It gets ONE row,
in a section of its own, so a single viewing ticks a single row. Filing it
inside either franchise would have made it look missing from the other.

WEIGHTS
-------
Every row carries `w`, hours from the runtime in that film's own Wikipedia
infobox. This is all-or-nothing on purpose: downstream, a row with no `w`
counts as one hour, so a single missing runtime would quietly invent time.
The build asserts all 33 runtimes were parsed rather than defaulted, and a
film whose infobox stated none would fail here instead of shipping a guess.
