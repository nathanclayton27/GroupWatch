"""Generate properties/halo.json.

    python3 tools/make_halo.py

The Halo campaigns in release order — Combat Evolved through Infinite,
with the two Halo Wars strategy campaigns as optional rows.

Which games exist and their release years come from Wikipedia's Halo
(franchise) article and its game timeline
(scratch/agent-games1/wiki/halo.wiki). Hours are HowLongToBeat main-story
figures — story only, the house standard — read from
tools/data/halo.json, collected by scratch/agent-games1/fetch_hltb.py and
verified by name (this generator refuses a record whose name is not what
it expects, and cross-checks HLTB's release year against Wikipedia's).

The Master Chief Collection note is stated as fact: it is the practical
way into everything up to Halo 4. Anniversary remasters, Spartan Assault/
Strike and the arcade releases are not campaigns in their own right and
are not rows.
