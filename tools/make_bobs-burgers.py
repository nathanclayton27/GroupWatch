"""Generate properties/bobs-burgers.json — every episode, one row each.

    python3 tools/make_bobs-burgers.py

Sixteen seasons on Fox, January 2011 to May 2026, in the order they went out.
312 rows covering the 313 episodes Wikipedia numbers; the single place those
two numbers part company is "The Bleakening", and it is explained below and
asserted in code rather than quietly absorbed.

WHAT IS IN. Episodes of the television series, and only those: the numbered
run Wikipedia's {{Series overview}} counts, 13 + 9 + 23 + 22 + 21 + 19 + 22 +
21 + 22 + 22 + 22 + 22 + 22 + 16 + 22 + 15. Nothing is re-ordered and nothing
is invented.

WHAT IS OUT, AND WHY.

  * "The Bob's Burgers Movie" (2022). The list article carries it, but under
    its own "Theatrical film" heading and with no episode number — it is not
    in the series overview and not in the infobox's 313. Futurama's four films
    are on this site as film rows because that list's unit is mixed by design
    and the films are the form that work was released in. Here the unit is the
    episode, no row carries a weight, and a cinema feature dropped among
    313 twenty-two-minute episodes would count exactly one, misrepresenting
    both it and them. It is named in the notes instead of being counted.
  * The two shorts, "My Butt Has a Fever" and "On the Fort Day of Christmas".
    Same section of the source, same absence of an episode number; the second
    has no airdate at all, which is disqualifying on its own.
  * The "Future episodes" table — nineteen titles known from WGA listings and
    writers' social media, with production codes or TBA and no airdate. A row
    on this list has an airdate the encyclopedia stands behind.

THE BLEAKENING IS ONE ROW. Season 8's Christmas special aired on December 10,
2017 as a single hour-long block. Wikipedia numbers it as episodes 6 and 7 of
the season (135 and 136 overall, production codes 7ASA16 and 7ASA17) and
counts it twice in the overview's 21, but gives it ONE title, ONE airdate and
one {{Episode list/sublist}} block with NumParts = 2 — the two halves have no
titles of their own. So the source's own episode table shows one row, and this
list shows one row too, labelled "6–7" and noting the hour. Shipping two rows
would mean inventing two titles, which is the one thing this generator is not
allowed to do. That is 312 rows for 313 numbered episodes; both numbers are
asserted, and the season 8 section says so in its own subtitle.

ORDER. Broadcast, which for this show is the only order there is. Fox has
aired Bob's Burgers out of production order in every single one of its sixteen
seasons — main() proves it rather than claiming it, by checking that no
season's production codes come out sorted — and the production cycles do not
line up with the broadcast seasons either (broadcast season 3 mixes 2ASA and
3ASA codes, season 14 is mostly the thirteenth production cycle). There is no
production ordering to follow that any box set, streaming season or source
article agrees with. Wikipedia's numbering and the airdates, meanwhile, agree
end to end: every season's dates are non-decreasing, and main() asserts it.

SEASON 16 IS FINISHED, AND THERE IS NO SEASON 17 YET. The list article carries
no {{Aired episodes}} stamp, so completeness is established from the articles
themselves: the season 16 infobox gives num_episodes = 15 and a closed
{{End date|2026|5|17}} rather than "present", all fifteen episodes carry a
sourced airdate, the last of them is that date, and the series infobox counts
16 seasons and 313 episodes. Season 17 has no article, no row in the series
overview and no heading on the list page — the show was renewed in April 2025
for four more seasons, through a nineteenth, but a renewal is not an airdate
and nothing unaired is listed here.

WEIGHTS. None, deliberately. Wikipedia documents running time once, for the
series, as a range — "20–23 minutes" in the television infobox — and not a
single {{Episode list}} block in any of the sixteen season articles carries a
RunTime or Length field. main() checks both of those before writing. There is
therefore no verifiable per-row number to weight with, and a half-weighted
list is worse than an unweighted one: the reader resolves
`WEIGHT = x.w >= 0 ? x.w : 1`, so a row with no `w` on an otherwise weighted
list silently counts as a full hour. It is all rows or none. It is none — even
for The Bleakening, whose own article gives 43:47, because one weighted row
among 311 unweighted ones is exactly the bug described.

THE BLURB CARRIES NO COUNT. The card prints the generated total three lines
above it; a hard-coded number in the blurb only survives until the next season
airs, and five other lists already contradict themselves that way. main()
asserts the blurb holds no digits at all.

Everything is machine-read from the cached Wikipedia wikitext in
scratch/bobs-burgers/ — "List of Bob's Burgers episodes", the sixteen season
articles and the series article. Nothing is typed in from memory. Before
anything is written: each season's numbered episode count is asserted against
that season's episodesN in the list article's own {{Series overview}} AND
against that season's own infobox num_episodes; each season's in-season
numbering is asserted to run 1..N; the overall numbering is asserted contiguous
1..313; airdates are asserted non-decreasing inside every season; the series
infobox's num_episodes and num_seasons are asserted to agree; the list page is
asserted to hold no numbered episode blocks of its own (so a generator that
read it instead of the season articles would ship the film and the shorts and
none of the show, which is precisely what it would have done); and the accent
pair is asserted unused by any other property.
